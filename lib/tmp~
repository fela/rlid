Oh, Master Ani!
I knew you would return.
I knew it!
Hello, 3PO.
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.
I've come to see my mother.
Oh. Um, I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.
I'm Anakin Skywalker.
Owen Lars. Uh, this is
my girlfriend, Beru.
Hello.
I guess
I'm your stepbrother.
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.
Is my mother here?
No, she's not.
Cliegg Lars.
Shmi is my wife.
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.
A hunting party
of Tusken Raiders.
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...
when they took her.
Those Tuskens walk like men...
but they're vicious,
mindless monsters.
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...
I just couldn't ride anymore
un-until I heal.
I don't want
to give up on her...
but she's been gone a month.
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.
Where are you going?
To find my mother.
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.
You're gonna have to stay here.
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.
I won't be long.
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.
What about the senator
from Naboo?
Is she dead yet?
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.
As I explained to you earlier...
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.
The Techno Union army...
is at your disposal, Count.
The Banking Clan
will sign your treaty.
Good. Very good.
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.
The Jedi
will be overwhelmed.
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.
Mom.
Mom? Mom?
Ani? Is it you?
I'm here, Mom.
You're safe.
Oh, you look
so handsome.
My son.
Oh, my grown-up son.
I'm so proud of you, Ani.
I missed you.
Now I am complete.
I love y--
Stay with me, Mom.
Everything--
I love--
I-- I love--
Anakin!Anakin! No-o-o!
Pain, suffering...
death I feel.
Something terrible
has happened.
Young Skywalker is in pain.
Terrible pain.
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?
We'll have to try something else.
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo. It's much closer.
Anakin, do you copy?
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
He's not on Naboo, R4.
I'm going to try
and widen the range.
I do hope nothing's
happened to him.
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...
but it's coming
from Tatooine.
What in the blazes
is he doing there?
I told him to stay on Naboo.
We haven't got
much time.
Anakin, do you copy?
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Retransmit this message--
Anakin, do you copy?
My long-range--
has been knocked out.
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.
I brought you something.
Are you hungry?
The shifter broke.
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.
But I couldn't--
Why'd she have to die?
Why couldn't I save her?
I know I could have!
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.
You're not all-powerful, Ani.
Well, I should be!
Someday I will be.
I will be
the most powerful Jedi ever!
I promise you.
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!
He's holding me back!
He's jealous!
He's holding me back!
What's wrong, Ani?
I killed them.
I killed them all.
They're dead.
Every single one of them.
And not just the men...
but the women...
and the children too.
They're like animals,
and I slaughtered them like animals!
I hate them!
To be angry
is to be human.
I'm a Jedi.
I know I'm better than this.
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.
Good-bye, my darling wife.
And thank you.
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.
I wasn't strong enough.
But I promise
I won't fail again.
I miss you...
so much.
R2? What are you
doing here?
It seems that he is carrying a message
from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Hmm. Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.
Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...
to the droid foundries
on Geonosis.
The Trade Federation is to take
delivery of a droid army here...
and it is clear
that Viceroy Gunray...
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming a--
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.
I agree.
Anakin, we will deal
with Count Dooku.
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.
Protect the senator
at all costs.
That is your first priority.
Understood, Master.
They'll never get there
in time to save him.
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.
Geonosis is
less than a parsec away.
If he's still alive.
Ani, are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?
He's your friend, your mentor. He's--
He's like my father!
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here!
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.
Count Dooku
must have made a treaty with them.
The debate is over.
Now we need that clone army.
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.
The senate will never approve the use
of clones before the separatists attack.
This is a crisis.
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.
He can then approve
the creation of an army.
But what senator would have the courage
to propose such a radical amendment?
If only...
Senator Amidala were here.
Traitor.
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.
They have gone too far.
This is madness.
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.
Well, I hope it doesn't take
too long. I have work to do.
May I ask why a Jedi knight...
is all the way out here
on Geonosis?
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.
Do you know him?
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.
The Geonosians
don't trust them.
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.
It's a great pity that our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.
I wish he were still alive.
I could use his help right now.
Qui-Gon Jinn
would never join you.
Don't be so sure,
my young Jedi.
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...
just as you
were once his.
He knew all about
the corruption in the senate...
but he would never have
gone along with it if he had
learned the truth as I have.
The truth?
The truth.
What if I told you
that the Republic...
was now under the control
of the dark lord of the Sith?
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...
of a Sith lord
called Darth Sidious.
I don't believe you.
The viceroy
of the Trade Federation...
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.
You must join me, Obi-Wan...
and together
we will destroy the Sith!
I will never join you, Dooku.
It may be difficult
to secure your release.
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...
wesa desa
Federation du Trade.
Senators, "dellowfelagates":
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...
mesa propose
that the senate...
give immediately
emergency powers...
to the supreme chancellor.
Palpatine! Palpatine! Palpatine!
Order! We shall have order!
It is with great reluctance...
that I have agreed
to this calling.
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.
The power you give me...
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.
And as my first act
with this new authority...
I will create a grand army
of the Republic...
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.
It is done, then.
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.
Visit I will
the cloners on Kamino, hmm...
and see this army they have
created for the Republic.
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?
They're exhaust vents
of some type.
That'll do.
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.
As a member
of the senate...
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.
Don't worry. I've given up
trying to argue with you.
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...
they would have
asked for it, hmm?
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.
For a mechanic...
you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.
I am programmed
to understand humans!
"What does that mean?" Oh!
That means I am in charge here!
Where are you going now?
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?
Oh! Idiot!
Please wait.
Do you know
where you're going?
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, my goodness!
Shut me down!
Machines making machines.
Huh! How perverse.
Calm down, R2.
I almost fell.
You'll get your chance--
Oh! I'm scrap.
It's a nightmare!
Oh, I want to go home! Ahh!
Oh, what did I do
to deserve this?
Hmm. I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.
He's always getting himself
into trouble. Oops.
Oh, no!
Uh-oh.
Oh, I'm so confused.
Oh, not again.
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.
Don't move,Jedi!
Take him away.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid to die.
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.
What are you talking about?
I love you.
You love me?
I thought that we had decided
not to fall in love...
that we would be forced
to live a lie...
and that it would
destroy our lives.
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.
I truly...
deeply love you...
and before we die,
I want you to know.
Eeyah!
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.
I retransmitted it just as
you had requested, Master.
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.
Good job.
Settle down. Settle down.
Let the executions begin.
I've got a bad feeling
about this.
Just relax. Concentrate.
What about Padmé?
She seems to be
on top of things.
She can't do that!
Shoot her or-- or something!
Whoa! Yah!
This isn't how it's supposed to be!
Jango! Finish her off!.
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.
Master Windu,
how pleasant of you to join us.
This party's over.
Brave but, uh, foolish,
my old Jedi friend.
You're impossibly outnumbered.
I don't think so.
We'll see.
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.
What's all this noise?
A-A battle!
Oh, there's been
some terrible mistake!
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!
Die,Jedi dogs!
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.
You call this
a diplomatic solution?
No, I call it
aggressive negotiations.
Uh-oh.
Roger, roger.
R2, what are you doing here?
What are you doing?
Oh, stop that!
You're going to strain
something. My neck!
Now where are you taking me?
Oh, this is such a drag.
Oh, I'm quite beside myself.
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!
Yes, but is my head on straight?
Master Windu,
you have fought gallantly...
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.
Now it is finished.
Surrender,
and your lives will be spared.
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!
Then, I'm sorry, old friend.
Look!
Look!
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.
Oh, I've had
the most peculiar dream.
If Dooku escapes...
rally more systems
to his cause he will.
Hold on!
Aim right above
the fuel cells!
Good call,
my young Padawan.
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.
That doesn't seem possible.
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?
We must send all available droids
into battle.
There are too many.
Our communications have been jammed.
Pilot, land in that assembly area!
Yes, sir.
Sir, I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.
To the forward
command center take me.
Attack those Federation starships!
Quickly!
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.
Very good.
Very good.
This is not looking good at all!
We must get the starships
back into space.
We have to order a retreat.
My master
will never allow the Republic...
to get away
with this treachery.
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.
They will be much safer there
with my master.
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.
Yes, sir.
Move all quadrants
to sector 5-1 -5.
Look over there!
It's Dooku!
Shoot him down!
We're out of rockets, sir.
Follow him!
We're gonna need some help!
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!
Put the ship down!
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way! Follow that speeder!
Lower the ship!
I can't take Dooku alone!
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!
We have a job to do!
I don't care! Put the ship down!
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!
I can't leave her!
Come to your senses!
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?
She would do her duty.
The droid army
is in full retreat.
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.
You're gonna pay for all
the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.
We'll take him together.
Go in slowly on the left.
I'm taking him now!
No, Anakin! No! No!
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.
Now... back down.
I don't think so.
Master Kenobi,
you disappoint me.
Yoda holds you
in such high esteem.
Surely you can do better.
Are you all right?
We'd better get back to
the forward command center.
No. No.
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.
Get a transport. Hurry!
Right away.
Brave of you, boy.
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.
I am a slow learner.
Master Yoda.
Count Dooku.
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.
Powerful you have become,
Dooku.
The dark side I sense in you.
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.
Even you.
Much to learn you still have.
It is obvious that
this contest cannot be decided
by our knowledge of the Force...
but by our skills
with a lightsaber.
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.
This is just the beginning.
The Force is with us,
Master Sidious.
Welcome home,
Lord Tyranus.
You have done well.
I have good news
for you, my lord.
The war has begun.
Excellent.
Everything is going
as planned.
Do you believe
what Count Dooku said...
about Sidious
controlling the senate?
It doesn't feel right.
Joined the dark side
Dooku has.
Mmm. Lies, deceit...
creating mistrust
are his ways now.
Nevertheless, I feel we
should keep a closer eye on the senate.
I agree.
Where is your apprentice?
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.
I have to admit that
without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.
Victory?

The great San Francisco acid wave.
I recall one night in a place
called the Matrix. There I was--
Mother of God. There I am.
Holy fuck.
Uh, clearly I was a victim
of the drug explosion...
a natural street freak
just eating whatever came by.
Does anybody want some LSD ?
I got all the makin's...
right here !
All I need is a place to cook.
I decided to eat only
half of the acid at first...
but I spilled the rest on the sleeve
of my red woolen shirt.
What's the trouble ?
Well, all this white stuff...
on my sleeve...
With a bit of luck...
his life
was ruined forever...
always thinking that just behind some
narrow door in all his favorite bars...
men in red woolen shirts...
are getting incredible kicks
from things he'll never know.
Strange memories on
this nervous night in Las Vegas.
Has it been five years ? Six ?
It seems like a lifetime, the kind
of peak that never comes again.
San Francisco
in the middle '60s...
was a very special time and place
to be a part of...
but no explanation...
no mix of words
or music or memories...
can touch that sense of knowing
that you were there and alive...
in that corner of time in the world,
whatever it meant.
There was madness
in any direction...
at any hour.
You could strike sparks anywhere.
There was a fantastic
universal sense...
that whatever we were doing was right,
that we were winning.
was the handle.
That sense
of inevitable victory...
over the forces
of old and evil.
Not in any mean or military sense--
we didn't need that.
Our energy
would simply prevail.
We had all the momentum.
We were riding the crest
of a high and beautiful wave.
So now, less than five years later...
you can go up a steep hill
in Las Vegas and look west...
and with the right kind
of eyes...
you can almost see
the high-water mark...
that place where the wave
finally broke...
and rolled back.
Room service !
Good morning, sir.
What do you want, man ?
What do you want ?
Room service.
Get out.
You're in the wrong room.
Get the fuck out !
I've got a gun. It's not mine, really.
Uh, the-- the-- the bill.
Will you... s-sign for it ?
Yeah, I'll get it. Hurry up.
Don't move, man.
Be very still.
There we go.
Say nothing
to no one, man.
The decision
to flee came suddenly. Or maybe not.
Maybe I'd planned it all along,
subconsciously waiting
for the right moment.
The bill was a factor, I think...
because I had no money to pay for it.
Our room service tabs had been
running somewhere between
29 and 36 dollars per hour...
for 48 consecutive hours.
Incredible.
How could it happen ?
But by the time I asked this question,
there was no one around to answer it.
That rotten attorney of mine,
Dr. Gonzo, was gone.
He must have sensed trouble.
It crept up my spine like
first-rising vibes of an acid frenzy.
All these horrible realities
began to dawn on me.
Here I was...
alone in Las Vegas,
completely twisted on drugs.
No cash,
no story for the magazine...
and on top of everything else
I had a gigantic goddamn
hotel bill to deal with.
I didn't even know
who'd won the race.
Maybe nobody.
How would Horatio Alger
have handled this situation ?
Stay calm.
Stay calm.
I'm a relatively
respectable citizen.
Multiple felon, perhaps,
but certainly not dangerous.
Luckily I had taken the soap
and grapefruit and other luggage
out to the car earlier.
Now--
it was only a matter
of slipping the noose.
Hey ! Here, take this.
All right.
Mr. Duke ! Mr. Duke !
We've been looking for you.
The game was up. They had me.
Many fine books have been written
in prison, huh ?
Sir ?
Um, this telegram
came for you.
Actually, it's not for you.
It's for somebody named, uh, Thompson.
But it says, "Care of Raoul Duke."
Do you-- Do you--
Does that mean anything ?
Yes, yes, it means a lot. Thanks.
Yeah, I checked the register
for this man Thompson.
We don't show him, but I figured
he might be part of your team.
He is. Don't worry. I'll get it to him.
Yeah.
Um, what confused us
was, uh...
Dr. Gonzo's signature
on the telegram from Los Angeles
when we knew he was right here.
You did the right thing.
Never try to understand a press message.
About half the time, we use codes.
Especially with Dr. Gonzo.
See ya.
Um, tell me.
When will the doctor
be awake ?
Awake ? What do you mean ?
Well, um...
my manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.
It's nothing unusual, um--
Mr. Heem likes to meet
all of our large accounts...
put'em on a personal basis,
you know ?
Just a chat and a handshake.
You understand.
Of course,
but if I were you...
I would leave the doctor alone
until after he's eaten his breakfast...
because he's
a very crude man.
Jesus God !
No !
But he will be available,
huh, maybe later this morning ?
Look, the telegram
is actually all scrambled.
It's actually from Thompson,
not to him.
All right ? Now, I've got to go.
I've gotta get to the race.
B-But there's no hurry.
The race is over.
Not for me.
Well, um--
Let's have lunch !
Righty-o, man.
Righty-o.
Jesus.
Bad waves of paranoia.
Madness. Fear and loathing.
Intolerable vibrations
in this place. Get out.
The weasels were closing in.
I could smell the ugly brutes.
Do me one last favor, Lord.
Just give me five more high-speed hours
before You bring the hammer down.
Just let me get rid of this goddamn car
and off this horrible desert.
Oh, you evil bastard.
This is Your work.
You better take care of me, Lord.
If You don't, You're
gonna have me on Your hands.
Pull over ! Pull over !
Hey !
Good morning. How are you ?
All right, man. Doing very well.
Few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a highway traffic cop.
Your normal speeder will panic
and immediately pull over to the side.
This is wrong.
It arouses contempt in the cop heart.
Make the bastard chase you.
He will follow.
But he won't know what to make
of your blinker signal that says
you're about to turn right.
This is to let him know you're
pulling off for a proper place to talk.
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.
But you will be ready.
Brace for the "G"s.
Fast heel-toe work.
Hi. How are you ?
Just what in the hell
did you think you were doing ?
I wanna know.
Let me see your license.
Oh, yeah, of course.
There you are.
Oh, my gosh.
It's me.
May I please have that ?
I knew I was fucked.
See you have two cases of beer,
a basket of grapefruit...
stack of T-shirts and towels,
light bulbs.
You realize what you did
when you drive like that ?
Yeah, I know. I'm guilty.
I understand that. I knew it
was a crime. I did it anyway.
Shit, why argue ?
I'm a fucking criminal. Look at me.
You have
a strange attitude.
Maybe.
You know, I have a feeling
you need to take a nap.
There's a rest area
just up ahead.
I'd like you to go up there,
pull over and get a few hours' sleep.
That's not gonna help me.
I've been awake for too long.
Three or four nights, maybe.
Can't even remember.
I go to sleep now,
I'm dead for 20 hours.
What are you carrying
two cases of soap for, son ?
I wanna stay clean.
No.
Here's how it is.
What I put in my book,
as of noon...
is that I apprehended you
for driving too fast.
I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area.
Stop !
I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area--
your stated destination, right ?
And take a long nap.
Do I make myself clear ?
Well...
how far is Baker ?
I was sort of hoping to,
I don't know, stop there for lunch.
It's not my jurisdiction.
City limits end 2.2 miles
beyond the rest area.
Can you make it that far ?
I'll try.
I've been wanting to go to Baker for
a long time. Yeah. Heard a lot about it.
Excellent seafood.
You know, I'm thinkin',
a guy with your kind of mind...
ought to try
the land-crab.
Excellent seafood.
Land-crab.
All right. Why not ?
Thanks for the tip.
Look at me in the eyes.
Everything all right ?
May I have a little kiss
before you go ?
I'm very lonely here.
I felt raped.
The pig had done me on all fronts.
And now he was going off to chuckle
about it on the west side of town...
waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.
Why, yes, Officer. Of course
I'll take advantage of that rest area.
And I can't tell you how grateful
I am for this break you wanna give me.
Get a grip, man.
If I boom straight for L.A.,
he'll bust me for sure.
No. This was not the time
for a showdown.
This was Death Valley.
Sweet Jesus, it's him.
Oh, my God !
Come on, you fucking bastard.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I've got to go. I've got to--
Well, they've nailed me,
goddamn it.
I'm trapped in some stinking
desert crossroads called Baker.
I don't have much time, man.
The fuckers are closing in.
They'll hunt me down
like a fucking beast.
You sound paranoid.
I need a fucking lawyer
immediately !
What are you doing in Baker ?
Didn't you get my telegram ?
What telegram, you worthless bastard ?
I'll cripple your ass for this.
You brainless scumbag,
you're supposed to be in Vegas.
I rented a suite
at the Flamingo.
You're supposed to be covering the
National District Attorney's conference.
I made all the reservations.
Everything is arranged.
Now, what the fuck are you doing out
there in the middle of the desert ?
Nothing. Never mind.
It's all a big joke.
I'm actually, uh-- I'm poolside
at the Flamingo right now...
talking through a portable phone some
dwarf brought out from the casino.
Yeah, I have total credit here.
Don't come anywhere
near this place, you bastard.
Foreigners
aren't welcome here.
Well, this is how
the world works.
All energy flows according
to the whims of the Great Magnet.
What a fool I was
to defy him.
I was going back to Vegas.
I had no choice.
I had to get rid
of the Shark.
Too many people might recognize it,
especially the Vegas police.
Luckily, my credit card
was still technically valid.
Now this
was a superior machine.
Ten grand worth of gimmicks
and high-priced special effects.
The rear windows leapt up with a touch
like frogs in a dynamite pond.
The dashboard was full of esoteric
lights and dials and meters...
that I would never understand.
If the pigs
were gathering in Vegas...
I felt the drug culture
should be represented as well.
And there was a certain bent appeal in
the notion of running a savage burn...
on one Las Vegas hotel...
and then just wheeling across town
and checking into another.
Me and a thousand ranking cops
from all over America.
Why not move confidently
into their midst ?
Welcome to the Flamingo Hotel, sir.
Sir ?
Yeah, hi. Right. Okay.
My arrival was badly timed.
This here model
is one that we had to use...
when we took on them little peckerheads
down there at Kent State.
This baby here--
I'm a police chief
from Michigan.
Look, fella, I have
explained to you.
I have this postcard which says that
I have a reservation in this hotel.
I'm very sorry, sir,
but you're on the late list.
So your reservation
has been transferred to...
It's okay.
the... Moonlight Motel...
which is just out
on Paradise Boulevard.
We've already paid
for our goddamn room !
It's actually a very fine
place of lodging, and it's
only 16 blocks from here.
It has a pool,
sauna, steam.
You listen to me,
you filthy little faggot !
I want a manager down here,
now, now !
Because I'm sick of listening
to your dog shit !
I am... very sorry, sir.
Get off of me ! Get away from me !
Can I call you a cab ?
Sure, and I'll call you
a cocksucker !
Of course, I could hear what
the clerk was really saying.
Listen, you fuzzy
little shithead !
I've been fucked around
in my time...
by a fairly good
cross section...
of mean-tempered,
rule-crazy cops...
and now...
it's my turn.
So fuck you, Officer.
I'm in charge.
Hey, listen, I really hate
to interrupt, but I wonder
if I could slide on through.
The name is Raoul Duke. I think
my attorney made the reservations.
Duke, Raoul.
Certainly, sir.
My bags-- My bags are out there in
that white Cadillac convertible there.
Maybe somebody could
bring it to the room for me.
Oh, yeah, uh, let me get
a quart of Wild Turkey...
two-fifths of Bacardi...
some ice for the room, and let's see--
You just calm down !
Shit, let's try some lime chunks.
What do you think ?
I say okay.
You don't worry about a thing.
Now, calm down.
You don't hesitate
to call me-- Sven.
All right, Sven.
Thank you very much.
You-- You--
I know, I know, I know.
It's hideous. You're gonna
be fine, though. You're doing well.
I'll see you later.
Wait. Don't touch it.
Good night. Pardon me. Bye, Sven.
Look what you did !
Look what you did !
Goddamn you, we wouldn't stay
in this hotel if you begged us !
Home, sweet home.
Whoa. What kind of sick shit--
Shit. What the fuck ?
Stop, stop, stop.
Ow ! She's biting my leg off !
You degenerate pig. Please !
Can't be helped.
My fucking leg !
That's "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
Lucy, be cool,
goddamn it.
Remember what happened
at the airport, okay ? Come on.
No more of that, okay ?
That's my client, Lucy.
That's Mr. Duke,
the famous journalist.
He's paying for this suite, Lucy.
He's on our side.
He loves artists.
Lucy paints portraits
of Barbra Streisand.
Yeah. Right ?
Um, I drew these from TV.
Really.
She came
all the way down--
What's the name of that town ?
Montana.
Montana. Just to give
these portraits to Barbra.
We're goin' over to the Americana
tonight to meet her backstage.
I desperately needed peace, rest...
sanctuary.
I hadn't counted on this:
finding my attorney on acid
and locked into some kind
of preternatural courtship.
Well...
they must have, uh,
brought the car around by now.
So...
why don't, uh...
ou-yay and... I-ay...
o-gay and, uh,
et-gay the...
out of the unk-tray.
Absolutely. Yeah.
Let's get the stuff.
We'll be right back, Lucy.
Give me a kiss ? One kiss, one kiss.
No.
No. No.
One kiss. Why not ?
Don't answer the phone.
God bless.
Well, what are your plans ?
Plans ?
The child in the bedroom.
I met her on the plane.
Yeah.
She's a religious freak.
I gave her a cap
before I realized--
Jesus, she's never
even had a drink.
Well, it'll probably work out.
We can keep her loaded, and then
peddle her ass at the drug convention.
Yeah, she's perfect
for this gig.
These cops'll go 50 bucks a head
to beat her into submission
and then gang-fuck her.
We can set her up in one
of these backstreet motels...
hang pictures of Jesus
all over the room, and then turn
these fucking pigs loose on her.
Hell, she's strong, man.
She'll hold her own.
Jesus Christ,
I knew you were sick...
but I never expected to hear
you actually say that kind of stuff.
You filthy bastard.
Straight economics, man.
This girl's a godsend.
Shit. She could
make us a grand a day.
That's ugly, man.
Stop talking like that.
Well, I figure she can do
about four at a time.
If we keep her full of acid, that's
more like two grand a day, maybe three.
Hold on, man.
What if I just jump on you
and beat the dog shit out of you ?
Would that make you feel any better,
you filthy bastard ?
All right,
listen to me.
In a few hours, she'll probably
be sane enough to work herself...
into some sort of towering Jesus-based
rage at the hazy recollection...
of being seduced by
some kind of cruel Samoan...
who fed her liquor and LSD,
dragged her to a Vegas hotel room...
and then savagely penetrated
every orifice in her little body...
with his throbbing,
uncircumcised member.
That's so ugly, man.
Well, truth hurts.
That's-- Argh !
Yeah.
Argh ! That's argh !
Argh !
Argh ?
Argh !
Argh.
I wanted to help her, man.
Well, you'll go straight
to the gas chamber for this one.
Even if you manage to beat that,
they'll still send you back to Nevada...
for rape
and consensual sodomy.
No, she's gotta go.
It doesn't pay to try to
help somebody these days, huh ?
Let's go.
Yeah. Americana Hotel ?
I need a reservation.
For my... niece.
Look, I want her treated very gently.
She's an artist and--
Fuck off. She might seem
a trifle high-strung.
She's doing her masters thesis
on, uh...
well, Barbra Streisand.
It's time to meet Barbra.
Last name ?
I'd rather not say. My brother's
in politics. Yeah, you understand.
I felt like a Nazi,
but it had to be done.
Yeah, yeah, righto. Okay, yeah. Bye.
Lucy was a potentially fatal
millstone on both our necks.
Hurry the fuck up !
There was absolutely no choice...
but to cut her adrift...
Jesus Christ. Take your time !
and hope her memory
was fucked.
Here's an extra ten bucks.
Make sure she gets there safely.
Hey, man, take off slowly.
Don't attract attention.
Let's find a good seafood restaurant
and eat some red salmon.
I feel a powerful lust
for red salmon.
Oh, no, man. We're gonna be late.
We gotta go.
Goddamn mescaline.
Why the fuck can't they
make it a little less pure ?
I welcome you...
to the third National
D.A.'s Convention...
on Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs.
And now,
without further ado...
the man who will define this cancer
eating at the heart of America...
Dr. L. Ron Bumquist.
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,
but I didn't believe they were real.
Not like this, man,
not hundreds of them.
They're actually pretty nice people
once you get to know them.
Know them ? I know these people
in my goddamn blood.
Don't say that word around here.
You'll get them excited.
You're right.
The most efficient way
for us to do this...
is for each one of us...
to try and attempt...
to imagine
what it is like inside...
of the possessed mind of the addict.
For example...
a dope fiend...
refers to the reefer butt...
as a "roach"...
because...
it resembles a cockroach.
What the fuck are these people
talking about ?
You've got to be crazy on acid to think
a joint looks like a goddamn cockroach.
You will notice
that I have distinguished...
four-- four distinct
states of being...
in the cannabis
or marijuana society.
They are cool, groovy...
hip and square.
Seldom, if ever--
Too crazy, man. Too crazy.
We should get the hell out.
What a fucking nightmare.
If he figures out
what is happening...
then he can rise
one notch...
and become hip.
And then if he can
convince himself...
to approve
of what is happening...
then he becomes groovy.
Groovy.
And then, after that,
he can actually raise himself...
to the rank of cool.
He can become one
of those...
cool guys.
Dr. Bumquist.
You think the anthropologist Margaret
Mead's strange behavior of late...
could be explained
by a private marijuana addiction ?
Good question.
I'm not really sure I can answer that.
But what I can tell you, sir,
is if Margaret Mead...
at her age...
smoked grass...
she'd have one hell
of a trip.
One more layer of deviance
to the woman.
This is fuckin' bullshit.
I'll be out
in the casino.
Go to hell !
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you for having me.
Projector, please.
Excuse me.
All right.
Know your dope fiend.
Your life may depend on it.
You will not be able to see his eyes,
because of Tea-Shades...
but his knuckles will be white
from inner tension.
And his pants will be
crusted with semen...
from constantly jacking off
when he can't find a rape victim.
He will stagger and babble
when questioned.
He will not respect your badge.
The dope fiend fears nothing.
He will attack for no reason,
with any weapon at his command...
including yours.
Excuse me.
Beware: any officer apprehending
a suspected marijuana addict...
Pardon me.
should use all
necessary force immediately.
Sorry. Pardon me.
One stitch in time on him
will usually save nine...
on you--
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Yeah ?
Yes, Mr. Duke, hello.
You have one message.
Call Lucy...
at the Americana Hotel, room 1600.
Hello ?
Lucy called.
Lucy called.
Lucy called, man.
Those two men in the dock,
they gave me the LSD.
They took me
to the hotel.
I don't know what they
done to me, but I remember...
it was horrible.
They gave you what ?
Castration !
Double castration !
Where's my .357 ?
Who the fuck knows, man ?
You can't leave me alone
in this snake pit.
You bastard, what did you do
with my .357 ?
This room is in my name.
Well, tough titty.
Okay, goddamn it !
You're right.
She's my problem. I'll call her,
I'll get her off our backs.
It's gone too fucking far.
No, I'll take care of the situation.
Relax.
Relax !
Let me handle this.
Where are my shoes ?
The Americana Hotel.
What did you do with my goddamn shoes ?
Room 1600, please.
As your attorney, I advise you to take a
hit out of the little brown bottle...
You won't need much.
Just a... tiny taste.
Let's have it.
Ah, there it is.
makes pure mescaline
seem like ginger beer, man.
Adrenochrome.
Adrenochrome ? Hmm.
Hello.
Hi, Lucy. God bless.
Yeah, it's me.
Hell, no, I taught the bastard
a lesson he'll never forget.
What ? No, not dead.
But he won't be bothering
anybody for a while.
Yeah, I left him out there.
I stomped him.
I pulled all his teeth out.
I remember thinking, Jesus...
what a terrible thing to lay
on somebody with a head full of acid.
But we have a problem.
That bastard cashed a bad check
downstairs and gave you as a reference.
They'll be looking
for both of you.
Yeah, I know, Lucy, but you
can't judge a book by its cover.
Some people are
just basically rotten.
Anyway, the last thing in the world
you wanna do is call this hotel again.
They'll trace the call,
put you behind bars.
No, I'm moving
to the Tropicana right away.
I'll use a different name.
I'll let you know what it is.
I gotta get off.
Probably have
this phone tapped, baby.
Yeah, it was horrible,
but it's all over now.
Oh, my God.
There's someone at the door.
There's someone at the door.
Christ ! Hey !
No ! I'm innocent !
It was Duke !
It was Duke !
I love you ! I love you !
Don't put that thing on me.
Whoo. Oh.
Well--
That's the last we should
be hearing from Lucy, man.
She's probably stuffing herself
down the incinerator about now.
You know what we need ?
We need some opium.
I remember
slumping on the bed.
His performance
had given me a bad jolt.
For a moment,
I thought his mind had snapped...
that he actually believed he was being
attacked by invisible enemies.
But the room was quiet again.
Where'd you get this ?
Never mind.
It's absolutely pure.
What kind of monster client
have you hooked up with this time ?
Satanism freak.
I think there's only
one source for this stuff--
the, uh, adrenaline gland...
from a living human body.
I know. The guy didn't
have any cash to pay me.
He offered me human blood,
said it would take me higher
than I'd ever been in my life.
I thought he was kidding...
so I told him I'd just as soon have
an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome...
or maybe just a fresh
adrenaline gland...
to chew on.
I could already feel
the stuff working on me.
The first wave felt like a combination
of mescaline and methedrine.
Maybe I should take a swim,
I thought.
Yes, sir.
They nailed this guy
for child molesting.
He swore he didn't do it.
Why should I fuck with children ?
he said. "They're too small."
Christ, what could I say ?
Even a goddamn werewolf
is entitled to legal counsel.
I didn't dare
to turn the creep down.
He might have picked up a letter opener
and gone after my...
pineal gland.
You know ?
Yeah.
Crazy.
Why not ?
Shit. We should
get some of that.
Just... eat a big handful
and see what happens.
Some of what ?
Extract of pineal.
Sure, that's a good idea.
One whiff of that stuff will turn you
into something out of a goddamn...
medical encyclopedia, man.
Beautiful
Man, your head would
swell up like a watermelon.
You'd gain about
a hundred pounds in two hours.
Grow claws,
bleeding warts.
Yes.
And then you'd notice
about six huge, hairy tits...
swelling up on your back.
You'd go blind.
Your body would turn to wax.
They'd have to put you
in a wheelbarrow.
And when you scream for help...
you'll sound
like a raccoon.
Man, I'll try
just about anything...
but I'd never in hell
touch a pineal gland.
Finish the fucking story, man !
What happened ?
What about the glands ?
Jesus, that stuff got right
on top of you, didn't it ?
Look at your face.
You're about to explode.
Maybe you could just...
shove me into the pool.
Man, if I put you in the pool right now,
you'll sink like a goddamn stone.
You took too much, man.
You took too much. Too much.
Don't try and fight it.
You'll get brain bubbles,
strokes, aneurysms.
You'll just wither up
and die.
They continue
killing innocent people !
Allowing the hopes for peace and
freedom of millions of people...
to be suffocated.
So tonight, we do.
The great silent majority.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
What kind of rat-bastard
psychotic would play that song
right now, at this moment ?
When I came to...
the general back-alley ambience
of the suite was so rotten...
so incredibly foul.
How long had I
been lying there ?
All these signs of violence.
What had happened ?
There was evidence in this room
of excessive consumption...
of almost every type of drug
known to civilized man since 1544 A.D.
Oh, ah, Debbie.
Thank God.
Oh, Debbie. Hmm ? Look.
What kind of addict would need
all these coconut husks
and crushed honeydew rinds ?
Would the presence of junkies account
for all these uneaten french fries ?
These puddles of glazed ketchup
on the bureau ?
Maybe so...
but then why all this booze...
and these crude pornographic
photos smeared with mustard...
that had dried
to a hard, yellow crust ?
These were not the hoofprints
of your normal God-fearing junkie.
It was too savage,
too aggressive.
Put your hands where I can see them.
Jesus God, man. Huh ?
Put your hands where I can see them.
Put your hands where I can see them !
Grim memories
and bad flashbacks.
Get a grip.
How many nights and weird mornings
had this shit been going on ?
Something ugly had happened.
I was sure of it.
Who is that ? Oh.
Shit, that's me.
Help me !
What the fuck ?
You're under arrest !
She must have used a pass key.
I was polishing my shoes
in the closet when I noticed
her sneaking in, so I took her.
What made you do it ?
Who paid you off ?
Nobody ! I'm the maid !
You're just as much
a part of it as they are.
Part of what ?
The goddamn dope ring. You must
know what's going on in this hotel.
Why do you think
we're here ?
I know you're the cops, but I thought
you were just here for the convention.
I swear. All I wanted to do
was clean up the room.
I don't know anything about no dope.
Come on, baby.
Don't try to tell us you never heard
of the Grange Gorman.
I swear to Jesus
I never heard of that stuff.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Maybe she's not part of it.
I swear I'm not.
I swear.
In that case,
maybe she can help.
Oh, yes, I'll help you
all you want.
I hate dope.
So do we.
I think we should put her on the
payroll, see what she comes up with.
You think you can handle it ?
One phone call every day.
Don't worry if it doesn't add up.
That's our problem.
Y-You'd pay me for that ?
You're damn right
we would.
But the first time that you say anything
about this to anybody...
you will go straight to prison
for the rest of your life.
What's your name ?
Alice.
Prove it !
Just ring Linen Service
and ask for Alice.
All right, Alice.
You'll be contacted
by Inspector Rock, Arthur Rock.
He'll be posing as a politician, but
you'll have no problem recognizing him.
That's right, Inspector Rock
will pay you in cash...
$1,000 on the ninth of every month.
Oh, Lord !
I'd do just about
anything for that.
You and a lot of other people.
Come here.
The password is:
One hand washes the other.
The minute you hear that,
you say, "l fear nothing."
I fear nothing.
I fear nothing !
Get the fuck out of here.
Oh, yeah, listen.
Nice meeting you.
Don't bother
to make up the room.
Just leave a pile of towels and soap
outside the door exactly at midnight.
That way we won't have to risk another
one of these little incidents, will we ?
Whatever you say, gentlemen.
Thank God for decent people.
I fear nothing !
Terrible gibberish. Splintered
memories looming up out of the time fog.
Just press play.
This is it, the American Dream.
We're sitting
on the main nerve right now.
Yeah, don't get me started.
The owner always wanted to run away and
join the circus when he was a kid.
Now the son of a bitch
owns the circus.
a real license to steal.
Oh, yeah. The American Dream
come true, man.
Pure Horatio Alger.
Yeah. Welcome
to the happy place.
Listen, let's get down
to brass tacks here.
How much for the ape ?
How much you got ?
How much do you think you'd take for the
ape ? Just wait here. I'll be back.
Madness. It made no sense at all.
I desperately
needed the facts.
What the fuck is going on ?
Where's the ape, man ?
Where's the ape ?
Forget about it.
He attacked an old man.
Bit off the head of the bartender,
then the cops came and took him away.
Is that your car ?
Somebody stop them !
You poor fools don't understand.
This car is property of the World Bank.
That money goes to lately.
You can't put on a circus
without a tent.
The top is completely jammed.
You're right.
There's something wrong
with the motor.
All right,
who has the story ?
Where are you, you fucking monkey ?
You can't do that !
You people voted
for Hubert Humphrey.
And you killed Jesus.
There was every reason to believe
that we'd been heading for trouble...
that we'd pushed our luck
a bit too far.
Oh, gosh ! God.
The possibility...
of physical
and mental collapse...
is now very real.
No sympathy for the devil.
Keep that in mind.
Uh, buy the ticket...
uh, take the ride.
Hey, there. You folks want
to buy some heroin ?
Hey, honkies ! Goddamn it !
Pull ahead,
will you ?
I want to sell you
some pure fucking scag !
Cheap ! The real stuff.
I just got back
from Vietnam.
I want to sell you
some pure fucking scag.
Now hear me, you bastard !
Pull over ! I'll kill you !
Pull over ! Come on !
Oh, shit. Oh, oh.
Let's see here.
The mentality of Las Vegas
is so grossly atavistic...
that a really massive crime
often slips by unrecognized.
North Vegas is where you go when you've
fucked up once too often on the strip...
and when you're not even welcome
in the cut-rate downtown places.
The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed like
a fairly safe haven from our storms.
No hassles, no talk.
Just a place to rest
and regroup.
I wasn't even hungry.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of
the North Star to put me on my guard.
Two glasses of ice water
with ice.
Two glasses of ice water
with ice.
Two.
She looked line a burnt-out
caricature of Jane Russell.
She was definitely
in charge here.
He did it very casually...
but I knew that our peace
was about to be shattered.
What was that ?
Don't give me that bullshit.
I know what that means,
you fat goddamn pimp bastard !
That's the name of a horse
I used to own, ma'am.
What's wrong with you ?
The question mark was emphasized.
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch.
I gotta take a lot of shit
in this place, but I don't have
to take it off no spic pimp !
Anybody that knows anything
knows that.
Go on ! Pay your check
and get out of here !
You want me to call the cops ?
I'll call the fuck--
Want me to call the cops ?
How much is that
lemon meringue pie ?
Her eyes were turgid with fear,
but her brain was functioning...
on some basic motor survival level.
Thirty-five cents.
How much is that lemon meringue pie ?
Thirty-five cents.
Whoo ! What a waste of talent.
No, honey,
I mean the whole pie.
The whole pie.
What, three ?
Three ? Four ?
Five ? Hmm ?
Five.
I'll be in the car.
The sight of the blade
had triggered bad memories.
The glazed look in her eyes
said her throat had been cut.
She was still in the grip
of paralysis when we left.
It was all over now.
We'd abused every rule
that Vegas lived by.
Threatening the locals, abusing
the tourists, terrifying the help.
The only chance now,
I felt...
was the possibility that
we'd gone to such excess...
that nobody in the position to bring
the hammer down on us...
could possibly believe it.
Fifteen minutes to get
my attorney to the airport...
but we'll make it.
Christ !
No ! Oh, fuck !
Whoa, shit ! Whoa, shit !
Oh, God. Oh, God.
You son of a bitch !
Oh, God.
You're going the wrong way.
The next left.
Go ! Fuck !
Take a right here.
Take a right here.
Goddamn it. We're lost.
What are we doing out here
on this godforsaken road ?
The airport's over there.
Goddamn it !
It's over there.
I've never missed a plane yet.
Hold on !
All right. I'm gonna drop you
right next to the plane.
Fuck you. I'm gonna have to take
the blame. They'll crucify me.
Right here, right here.
Ridiculous, man.
Just say you were hitchhiking
to the airport, and I picked you up.
You bastard.
Get out.
Hey, hey !
Hey, listen.
Don't take any guff
from these swine.
If you have any trouble,
remember:
you can always send a telegram
to the right people.
Yeah, explaining my position. Some
asshole wrote a poem about that once.
Probably good advice,
if you have shit for brains.
There he goes...
one of God's own prototypes.
A high-powered mutant of some kind never
even considered for mass production.
Too weird to live, and too rare to die.
We're all wired
into a survival trip now.
No more of the speed
that fueled the '60s.
That was the fatal flaw
in Tim Leary's trip.
He crashed around America,
selling "consciousness expansion"...
without ever giving a thought
to the grim meat-hook realities
that were lying in wait...
for all those people
who took him seriously.
All those pathetically eager
acid freaks...
who thought they could buy peace and
understanding for three bucks a hit.
But their loss
and failure...
is ours too.
What Leary took down with him was the
central illusion of a whole lifestyle...
that he helped create.
A generation
of permanent cripples...
failed seekers...
who never understood the essential
old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture:
the desperate assumption
that somebody...
or at least some force...
is tending the light
at the end of the tunnel.
There was only one road
back to L.A.
U.S. Interstate 15.
Just a flat out high-speed burn
through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo.
Then onto the Hollywood Freeway,
straight into frantic oblivion...
safety, obscurity.
Just another freak...
in the freak kingdom.
Then why don't you stop him, Avi?
What the fuck do you know?
Shoot that toad now.
One more step, Avi.
Just like a squeeze of toothpaste.
You realise what you're doing, Mr Green?
Hold on, Jake. This isn't the plan.
This won't have a happy ending.
One more step, Avi.
Wake up, Mr Green.
Congratulations, Mr Green.
It's past the third day and you have risen.
I think you're due for a check-up.
Did the bad guys get you?
There's no such thing as "bad guys", Rachel.
Yes, there are.
That's why Daddy's friends are looking after us.
Never mind about that. Why don't you be a
good girl and get your Uncle Jake a cold drink?
It's a bit of a mess, isn't it?
Things will sort themselves out.
Is she all right?
Don't you worry about her.
You just look after yourself.
Mr Green, I don't know how to tell you this.
Our first results,
they must have been wrong.
I cannot apologise enough for this error.
You're not a well man, but...
We have to assess our clients very carefully.
There is something about yourself
that you don't know.
Something that you will deny even exists
until it's too late to do anything about it.
It's the only reason you get up in the morning,
the only reason you suffer the shitty boss,
the blood, the sweat and the tears.
This is because you want people to know
how good, attractive, generous, funny,
wild and clever you really are.
"Fear or revere me,
but please think I'm special."
We share an addiction.
We're approval junkies.
We're all in it for the slap on the back
and the gold watch.
The "hip, hip, hoo-fucking-rah."
Look at the clever boy
with the badge, polishing his trophy.
Shine on, you crazy diamond.
Cos we're just monkeys wrapped in suits,
begging for the approval of others.
If we knew this, we wouldn't do this.
Someone is hiding it from us.
And if you had a second chance,
you would ask...
Why what?
Why am I still alive?
Why did you give my money away?
Why didn't you want 'em to know?
Why didn't you want me to know?
You'll find out soon enough.
Whilst I've been digging around on Lord John
I came across a couple
of cash-talking shit-sniffers
who came up with the name...
Green.
That's right, Jake Green.
Go on.
I'm working for his brother.
Patrick.
A couple of opportunists, looking after
his older brother, got a little bit greedy.
Want to impress you.
All right, you take Sorter and Slim Biggins
and enough men to avoid an excuse.
It's about fucking time.
Now that is a picture.
You took your sweet-ass time.
I was starting to get bored.
You should have kept busy with a swim.
Funny you should say that.
Zach's quite a swimmer, aren't you, Zach?
20 lengths in ten seconds.
We thought it might be a record. You want
to try to beat it? Come on in and join us.
I'll just pop upstairs, grab my trunks,
and be down in a jiffy.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, and why is that, Avi?
Why do you think we're in this icy birdbath,
when we could be upstairs, toasty
and cosy, watching the naughty channel?
How long can it take to get five coffees
and a couple of pizzas?
You are on your own, Jakey boy.
Move.
You've got to tell the boss.
Why me?
Because you're the one who ordered the pizza.
This time you're going to tell me what's going on.
Two sugars, am I right?
Forget the tea, Avi.
Thank you, Jenny, that will be all.
You didn't tell us the truth
about the three Eddies did you, Mr Green?
The Eddies upset Macha in some way
so he had them used as aggregate, and mixed
into some concrete on one of his buildings.
Would you like us to remind you
of what really happened?
The Eddies were waiting for you
when you got out of prison.
It was Macha's fault.
They didn't work for him any more,
and wanted to...
...compensate you.
What they really meant was they wanted...
...to put 12 grams of angry lead
in the back of your fucking head.
But you gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.
No-one kills a man
who's going to make 'em money.
So you would give them 3% a month
on any money they would lend you.
You needed the money quickly for some small
but profitable deal that you'd made on the inside.
In fact, it was more profitable than any rate
they can get anywhere, legal or illegal.
So, one of them said...
A month later he got his money back.
Plus your 3%.
Now, nobody kills a man...
...who's going to make him money.
They always protect their investment.
I can give you 4% a month.
You know this is just between us?
That's right, Eddie.
Next deal - this time they're all in.
I give you 4% a month.
For two years you always came through,
regular like clockwork.
But there was no deal.
You would take money off of one Eddie
and repay the other Eddie, plus the 4%.
Plus your 4%. On top.
You were not greedy, you did it nice and slow.
You were paying for their trust.
This is just between us, right, Jake?
That's right, Eddie.
It was the easiest money they'd known. Soon
they couldn't give you their money fast enough.
A few months later they didn't
have enough of their own to lend,
so they started to borrow money off Macha.
Plus your 3%.
Plus your 4%.
Macha became interested.
How could the Eddies
have such a good little earner?
They hid you like a dirty little secret.
Find out who's behind this.
Who's behind this?
Ask no questions, hear no lies.
They tell anything but the truth.
Find out if Green is behind this.
Is Jake Green behind this?
I'll tell you, no, it's not Jake Green.
They'd do anything to protect their investment.
I'm not sharing the golden goose.
But Macha got his interest,
so he kept loaning them more and more.
Lend them the money.
You were back gambling, making more money
than you knew what to do with. You were rich.
I am rich.
Seriously fucking rich.
After a year, you had enough of the Eddies'
money, or should I say Macha's money...
Now I'm richer. A lot fucking richer.
...to buy a chain of hotels.
So you went on a discreet three-month holiday.
You took your brother, his daughter,
Macha's money and you enjoyed yourself.
A bit of the old sun, sand, sea and sausages.
The Eddies meanwhile
were having a terminal argument...
...about how they were going to pay back Macha
that obscene amount of cash they owed him.
I want my money back, Paul.
Those boys really suffered, Jake. The more
they told the truth, the more they suffered.
It's Jake Green.
He's telling the fucking truth.
They told me that story already.
Give me the truth.
You gave them just enough rope
to hang themselves.
You're a good little conman, Jake.
And you think you're smart, and you are,
just not as smart as you think you are.
Elvis. Come here.
If I wanted vinegar,
I would have ordered French fries.
Get me something with a price tag on it.
...Mr Green. What did he do, anyway?
It's OK, we're among friends.
Come on, what have you got for me?
What am I going to tell him?
That's your problem, but it had better be good.
I turned up to pick them up...
...and that is what I saw.
That's a fascinating story.
I have one question for you.
How?
How what?
How what?
There were six of us,
plus Slim Biggins, who counts as another six.
How many were there of him?
One.
One.
So, how exactly did this "one"
manage to disarm and overpower
a four-time national body-building champion,
drag him half a block, throw him over a six-foot
wall and then get him to eat his own gun?
Get down, boss.
Just find the gunman.
Don't fucking move.
Lou. Lou.
Keep the boss down.
What the fuck's going on?
I don't know.
Sorter just shot the...
...and he went in the kitchen.
Nobody fucking move.
Bastard.
Keep the fucking boss down.
She shot my finger off.
The bitch shot my finger off.
Who is it?
Happy Tony, Lord John's man.
Not looking so happy now, is he?
Check she's dead, Lou.
Greed gets them all in the end.
Now, shoot straight, Sorter.
Glad to see you've got those feelings in check.
Find a couple of Lord John's boys and
persuade them to tell you where my powder is.
What is the first rule of any game, Mr Green?
The only way to get smarter
is by playing a smarter opponent.
What's rule two of any game?
The more sophisticated the game,
the more sophisticated the opponent.
Almost the same,
but where does it stop, Mr Green?
Where does this game stop?
It stops when you start to give me answers.
Don't let them play head games with you, Jake.
Is it me that's playing head games with you,
Mr Green?
You've heard their voice for so long,
you believe it to be you.
You believe it to be your best friend.
They should believe
their opponent to be their best friend.
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?
In the very last place you would ever look.
Do you know who Sam Gold is, Mr Green?
You should,
because he knows who you are.
The Gold,
Sam Gold.
Mr Clandestine.
Mr Ambiguous.
Mr Mystery.
He's all up here,
pretending to be you.
No-one sees Gold,
but Gold sees everything.
You're in a game, Jake.
You're in the game.
Everyone's in his game,
and nobody knows it.
And all of this, this is his world.
He owns it.
He controls it.
I've had enough of this shit.
Tell him you've had enough.
He tells you what to do...
Look, that's enough.
...and when to do it.
Tell him.
I said that's enough, Avi.
Eventually, when the opponent
is challenged or questioned,
it means the victim's investment
and thus his intelligence is questioned.
No-one can accept that,
not even to themselves.
He's behind all the pain there ever was.
Behind every crime ever committed.
How can I be behind all the pain,
all the crime, if I don't even exist?
And right now,
he's telling you that he doesn't even exist.
No-one lives and displeases Gold.
No-one but your two friends.
We just put you to war
with the only enemy that ever existed,
and you, you think he's your best friend.
And they will protect their best friend
with everything they've got.
You're protecting him, Mr Green,
but with what?
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?
In the very last place you'd ever look.
He's hiding behind your pain, Jake.
You're protecting him with your pain.
Embrace the pain and you will win this game.
And I know nothing hurts more
than humiliation and a little money loss.
If you change the rules on what controls you...
...you will change the rules
on what you can control.
How radical are you prepared to be, Mr Green?
The more power
you think you have in Gold's world,
the less power you have in the real world.
You are still in prison, Jake.
In fact, you never left.
Remember who they are, Jake.
Head tricksters, word slicksters.
You wanted answers and they gave you riddles.
You know the rules,
the longer you listened, the sweeter the pitch.
He's got all the tricks and all the right answers.
Don't let them do this to you, Jake.
Don't let them turn you against you.
You don't give because it's good.
You give because it hurts him.
What are we doing here?
He's the enemy, Jake, not me.
Use your perceived enemy
to destroy your real enemy.
Do not listen, Jake.
You've got a gun. Use it.
Don't wake him up. Suffocate him.
Put the pillow over his head and suffocate him.
He'd do it to you, Jake.
If you can't do it, then you're not a free man.
You are controlled.
Controlled? Free man?
Jake, wake up.
Look, Mr Macha, I'm very sorry
to have woken you. Please listen to me.
Who's that? Mr Green?
Mr Macha, please, I'm sorry to have woken you.
Listen to me.
"Sorry." Listen at how you sound.
I came to apologise.
Forgive me for the things I've said
and for cheating you out of your money.
I couldn't think clearly.
No, no, that's too much.
Shoot the fucker. Shoot him.
He's been trying to kill you.
He killed your friend, shot like a fucking dog.
That's better, Jake, in control again.
Do the right thing.
Take care of your enemy, take care of business.
Use any means possible
to induce head pain, and engage the enemy.
Wake up, Jake.
What are you fucking doing?
Leave it.
You're grovelling.
I now realise you're a man
to be feared and respected.
I now realise you're a man
to be feared and respected.
Stop grovelling.
Where's your pride?
Where's your pride?
I made a big mistake, Mr Macha.
I underestimated your power and your intellect.
I've made a donation in your name
as a peace offering,
as a token of my apology.
I want you to...
I want you to forgive my stupidity.
Wherever you don't want to go
is where you will find him.
What is it that you are afraid of, Mr Green?
Why are you doing this to yourself, Jake?
It's too tight, Jake.
We've got to get out.
You're going to die in a tiny space, Jake.
Have to get out.
We're stuck, stuck.
The walls are moving in.
It's tight. I'm scared.
We've got to get out. I can hear you.
I can hear you.
I can hear you.
I'm onto you.
Who takes care of the good times?
We're a team.
We're best pals, Jake.
You want to get rid of me?
Do you know life without me?
No. Because it doesn't...
...exist.
Do they talk about me, Jake?
No.
Because I don't exist.
Tell all your friends about me then, Jake?
I protect you and I control you.
I say do, you obey.
If I say you're scared...
...you're scared.
You've been listening to the other side,
haven't you, Jake?
Listening to people who want to hurt you.
New people. New.
Not old friends like me.
People you shouldn't trust. Not me. I've been
your friend forever, since the beginning.
Get rid of them, Jake, forever.
They're the enemy, not me.
They're new, I'm old. I stay, they go.
I say you do.
You do.
You're weak without me, weak.
It's us against them, Jake.
It's us against them.
I'm coming to get you.
You want to get rid of me?
You want to make an enemy out of me?
You want to get rid of me, do you?
Do you?
You want to get rid of me, me, me, me?
Still here, Jake?
How long have I looked after you?
You can't win this one without me.
You know why?
I am you.
You ain't me.
The greatest con that he ever pulled,
was making you believe that he is you.
You ain't me.
I am you.
You're not me.
Come on.
Your best fucking friend.
I am you.
You don't control me.
I control you.
You come to my house with a loaded gun.
You speak to me like I'm a fucking idiot.
What's your game?
What's your game?
Speak to me.
Speak to me.
Or I'll kill you like the fucking dog that you are.
Fear me.
Fear me.
We have already killed Lord John
and two of your colleagues.
If you value your life
more than a few bags of white powder,
you will tell me...
where it is hidden.
Is everything all right, Mr D?
It will be when you take care
of my security, Paul.
What are you holding the papers for?
Because you're on the cover of half of them.
If you don't mind me asking,
what has come over you, Mr D?
They think you did it.
Oh, my god.
Take the credit, they'll never know.
This feels good.
This feels quite good.
I'm going to take the credit.
It might come as a surprise to you, Paul,
but I do have a heart.
I have some news about Green.
I'll give you news about Green.
He now knows who's boss.
He was snivelling like a baby
begging for forgiveness.
It was embarrassing. We're not going to
be hearing from Mr Green for a while.
I'm not sure if that's the case, Mr D.
Whilst you've been sleeping, we've been busy.
If Lord John's boys know where the powder is,
they took it to the grave.
We know Green's behind everything.
He took your powder, not Lord John.
He's been playing games with us,
and he's been playing games with you.
Fear me. Fear me.
Fear me.
Fear me.
It doesn't look good.
It doesn't look good.
The drums have been talking.
And what have the drums been saying?
They've been saying
what Sam Gold's been hearing.
Fear me.
Hearing about the little problems Mr Green
has been giving us, that's embarrassing.
We have an address for his brother.
We can take care of it.
Get him to talk, do whatever it takes.
Take Sorter and an army.
If they give any trouble, hurt 'em.
Let me read about that in the paper.
Get a hold of Green and get my powder.
Go.
Are we expecting anyone?
I'll get it.
I said, are we expecting anyone?
Shouldn't you check first?
If you love your daddy,
be a good girl, hide in that cupboard.
Now.
Check the house.
You know why we're here?
Serpent.
I said, do you know why we're here?
I've some kind of an idea, yes.
Are you going to tell me?
Paul, I swear to you,
I haven't got a fucking clue where he is.
He's been moving about.
I swear to you, I have no idea where he is.
It's all right.
That's it. That's better. That's better.
I still don't believe you.
You can't trust anyone.
They're out to destroy me.
They're out to destroy you.
You can't trust anyone.
I can't trust anyone.
Can't let Gold down.
He'll finish the business.
Then he'll finish me.
He's coming.
I won't see it coming.
He's coming. And I won't see it coming.
There's a woman here to see you, Mr D.
Said she cannot wait.
Don't tell me her name.
Says she works for Gold.
Don't tell me her name. Anyone but her.
What's her name?
Walker.
Anyone but her.
And everybody thought you were
such a disgusting man, Mr Macha.
Here it comes. Here it comes.
Mr Gold wishes to extend his respect
for such a magnanimous gesture.
But he was wondering...
That's a wreath.
That's a fucking wreath.
...if you can afford the time to give so generously,
why you haven't had time
to conclude our business?
Everything's under control. I need more time.
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr Macha?
Mr Gold doesn't give more time.
And he doesn't give second chances.
You will be hearing from him.
Good day.
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?
What the fuck does that mean?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Some fucking street hustler?
If he wants to meet me, you send him here
and we'll see what he has to say.
I'll kill 'em, I'll kill all of 'em.
I'll kill 'em first.
They'll kill us first, they'll fucking annihilate me.
Beg, beg. Take it back, beg, beg.
Beg, you idiot.
Wait, wait. I didn't mean what I just said.
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?
That means he's going to end my game
and I won't see it coming.
I'm going to make this fair.
...is for you.
These...
...for me.
One good chop, and you'll make the sink.
OK, that's enough.
Question me again, Sorter,
and we will have a falling out.
Tell me what's happening, Lou.
I got tired of waiting by the car, so I went inside.
Paul, he was getting excited,
you know how he does.
He started messing with the little girl's hair.
Out of nowhere, Sorter shot him.
Your daddy loves you so much.
Shot who?
Paul.
Then he turned the gun on the two bodyguards,
both gone in a blink of an eye.
Listen to me, sweetheart.
None of this is real.
It's just a game that the grown-ups are playing.
Now what I want you to do,
I want you to get in the cupboard
and I want you to put your fingers in your ears,
and it'll be all over before you know it.
Do as the man says, babe.
Put your fingers in your ears
and go in the cupboard.
Good girl.
Pull yourself together, man.
Sorter, we're going to have to take the girl.
Of course you have.
Now all you've got to do is come and get her.
I'm the only one left.
Where's the girl?
What are we doing here?
One last treat,
and bring the powder.
Jake Green is in the Casino.
How the fuck does he know?
Why are we here?
You have a meeting.
Got a little time to spare.
Let's have a game.
Bring him up.
You know what's so elegant
about this little game, Jake?
Nobody knows where the enemy is.
They don't even know he exists.
He's in every one of their heads.
And they trust him...
...because they think they are him.
If you try to destroy him to save them,
they'll destroy you to save him.
It's beautiful, man.
You have to admire the opponent's elegance.
Check.
You're quite good at this game, Mr Green.
I know because I'm quite good at this game.
Check.
Check.
Check.
The art is for me to feed pieces to you,
and make you believe you took those pieces,
because you're smarter and I'm dumber.
Checkmate.
Wake up, Mr Green.
You can't see what's right in front of you.
I never saw or spoke to those boys
in all those years,
but you know
I would have died for either one of them.
One was a chess master,
the other a master conman.
Dangerous combination, chess and cons.
Those two knew everything about me.
All my dirty little secrets,
how much money I had, where I kept it.
Hustling bastards cleaned me out.
My neighbours used to write down chess moves
and concepts of the con
in the back pages of books based on subjects
like The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.
Wake up, Mr Green.
We were all going to go together,
they swore to me.
You're coming with us, Jake.
We were always going to take you with us, Jake.
You just weren't ready to hear
how hard that was going to be.
We didn't do this because we like you.
We did this because...
...we are you.
Time for that meeting.
Give him what he wants.
I'm sure that will make him very happy.
I know you're still there,
cos I can feel you dying.
I can hear you, tapping me for a little nutrition.
Now who's clucking for a fix?
Think it's a little tight in here, do you?
You're not wrong,
cos the walls are moving in.
No food here, not today, sunshine.
My eyes are open and the restaurant's closed.
Jog on, slide off.
Find someone else to fill your pipe,
someone who won't see you coming
or know when you're there.
You think I'm an evil man.
You think I am an evil man, don't you?
Rachel, look at me, honey.
Think I don't know your fucking game?
I do, I know your game,
I see your game, I am your game.
Rachel, look at me, baby.
You don't play by the rules, Mr Green.
You like to play silly games with my head,
don't you?
You're a fucking survivor,
A winner.
You're a pussy drowning in his own shit.
Shut up and leave me alone.
He chose his hiding place very carefully.
I can't let him kill me.
You're weak. It's too late.
You're a dead man anyway.
You'll be dead before dawn.
The word "excuse" does not exist
in Sam Gold's lexicon.
This is Sam Gold I found myself chained to.
Mr Black Magic.
Mr "l-run-this-game" Gold.
We can't see Gold.
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.
No-one gets away from Gold.
Get control of yourself.
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr Macha?
He's going to kill me, he'll kill me.
Where's your pride? Where's your pride?
I'd rather kill myself than let him kill me.
Why isn't he scared? He's just staring at me.
You'll be hearing from him.
But he can't kill a dead man.
But he can't kill a dead man,
can he?
He can't kill a dead man, can he?
You can't even do it, can you?



You haven't been goingto
your G.A. meetings.
The department mandated six.
I haven't laid a bet in three months.
Bonded forever by what we went through.
Do you remember going to visit Mr.
Dalton in jail three weeks ago?
Hello.
Felicia broke into the bank.
I know that I made the 9-1-1 call.
How could you not tell me?
I'm pregnant.
I take my responsibility very seriously.
Why do you keep on coming here?
You've become important to me.
It might do you some good
to really be where you are.
That sounds a lot like something you
might say to someone you're in a
relationship with.
Look, I know what you went through together.
No, I don't think you do.
Do you even have any idea what you
are getting into with this guy?
Is there something we
all need to talk about?
What happened in there?
Hour 2 - 4:27 PM
None of you people smoke?
I don't have any.
Well, Tom, you look a little better.
How do you feel?
My head hurts.
All right, you've still got to
stay down, okay? Take it easy.
It's mine.
Lizzie...
It's mine.
I told you to turn it off.
I know.
I got it.
Uh... uh, I-I can... wait.
Somebody needs to get
me a damn cigarette.
Forget the cigarette.
Please just stop that damn phone!
What's that you say?
I can't hear you.
Please don't. She's having...
You don't want to keep 'em hanging.
Shut up, cop.
You got a team full of negotiators
out there ready to work for you.
Ask 'em for a car,
a chopper, a private plane,
whatever you want.
Somehow I don't think I'm
gonna get whatever I want.
You start sending out hostages, you will.
Nobody's leaving here before we do.
You got ten people in here.
Send out one, get some smokes.
It's one less person to cover.
Give up a hostage for a pack of cigarettes?
Ask for something you want,
see if they're gonna cooperate.
At least start the process.
Otherwise, we're all
gonna be sitting here
staring at each other
until we run out of time.
We want to make a trade.
Cigarettes and some food.
We'll give you one.
No, we'll decide.
So who wants out, huh?
Step right up!
Hey, we should talk about this.
No, no! Let's see what they think.
Any volunteers?
The security guard. Wounded go first.
Security guard stays.
Come on. Don't be shy.
Who wants out?
Mother, don't say anything.
Hey, Randall.
It's a democracy.
How about a show of hands?
But he's hurt.
Just put your hand up.
So you want out?
Of course she wants out.
We all want out.
Take my sister!
She has a little boy at home.
Sisters, huh?
Well,
we are definitely not separating you two.
Then send 'em both.
That's two less people
you gotta worry about.
Nobody asked you, cop.
That's enough!
Hey, ty-d bol man, How about you?
You want out?
What, you don't care?
You don't want to be free?
I think you should let somebody else go,
one of the women.
Children are first to go.
My  daughter's back there somewhere.
She should go.
Try that one.
Felicia, honey.
It's okay. It's okay, baby.
It's okay.
Come on out.
Everything's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get
you out of here.
Look at me. I promise, okay?
Come on with me so
we can get you home.
It's all right, baby.
You're goin' home.
We got her.
What the hell was she doing in here?
She was hiding. It's all right.
So you want to send her?
She's a kid.
Yeah, a kid with
a pink cell phone.
La dee dah.
You're the one who did this?
Now wait a minute.
She didn't know what she was doing.
All those cops out there
pointing their guns at us...
We would have been out of here by now!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
God!
There is no way we're
sending her out,
'cause she is what's gonna keep
the big man in line.
Hold on.
The cops already know she's in here.
They would have traced her cell.
The best way to earn yourself
some good will, send out a kid.
We gotta get this
cop outta here.
Now wait a minute.
Just wait a minute!
I have been on the other
side of these standoffs.
I know exactly what
they're thinking out there.
I know exactly what their
next move's gonna be.
You got a *** out there.
Out there just dying to take
over from the negotiators,
and I am the guy that can
keep them working with you.
You need me in here.
He's right!
I mean,
we've all seen the movies.
If they've got a cop in here, they're
less likely to come in with their
guns blazing.
Now if you're not gonna
take the injured guy,
you're  not gonna take the girl,
take her. What's your name?
Uh, Na-Nancy hale.
Take Nancy.
She's the oldest.
That's gonna win you points out there.
Besides, she's been driving you
crazy since this whole thing started.
Tie me up if you want to,
handcuff me.
But keep me in here.

One month later.
How's it going?
Hey.
Making up a little,
uh, tortilla soup.
So you, uh,
never came home last night.
I was on a stakeout.
I called the station a couple of times,
left some messages.
Egan, you had a wife.
I had a wife.
We got rid of 'em.
Let's not be wives.
Just  a concerned friend...
not a wife.
I thought you were looking for
your own place. How's that going?
Stalled for the moment.
The geo's in the shop.
I'll take you.
All right. You sure?
I-I don't want to be a bother
on your day off.
It's no bother, really.
All right, I got it. I got it.
Cavanaugh residence.
Hey, Egan. It's Kathryn.
Kathryn Hale...
Ho ho.
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?
Well, actually I was hoping
to get ahold of Nick.
Oh, of course.
Uh, yeah, he's right her hold on.
Oh, uh, wait a second.
By the way,
I'm having some people over
to play poker here tomorrow night.
I don't, uh, suppose you'd be available?
Oh, I wish I could,
but I actually have this thing with Ed.
Well, what a
grave disappointment.
Here's the man.
A poker party?
Yeah, I found your chips.
I figured, "Hey, you play!"
How's it going?
Okay. You?
Working hard, you know?
So you know what? Listen...
I know that this is not
the most brilliant timing,
but my mother has been after me
every day about this lunch thing,
you know,
so she can finally thank you.
If you, you know, if you have it in
you for another hero ceremony...
Yeah, I think I can manage it.
Really?
If it'll lighten your load.
Uh, god, thank you.
I can be there as a
buffer if you need me.
Uh, please.
Uh, how about tomorrow around 1:00
at the, uh, Orange Tree café on third?
With bells on.
Good.
All right, I'll see you then.
I'll see you.
What's with the alarm?
Mom said it's been going off all day.
I tried that. Yeah,
could you just send someone out here?
I'm off in a minute.
What are you reading?
Schoolwork on a friday night, huh?
Well, what else am I supposed to do?
I'm under house arrest.
Well, that's what happens when you
lie to us, young lady, so no pouting.
Dinner's ready to go
on the stove, baby.
And you can just order
something for tomorrow.
We will be fine.
Just have a good trip and make sure you
call as soon as you get there, okay?
And the alarm company's supposed
to call back. I left the number.
I got it.
Okay, I love you. Mm.
I love you, too.
Be good now.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
How long is this gonna last?
Felicia, you went to a men's prison.
Then you broke into the bank.
I think we've got every reason in the
world to keep you around for a while.
Come on now.
It doesn't have to be that bad,
spending the weekend with your father,
does it?
Let's have some dinner.
I'm Lizzie Miller.
I was hoping to see Lucas.
Lift your arms for me.
Don't you need to ask him if it's okay?
He's been expecting you.
Can I help?
That's okay. I got it.
I just found out they're
moving you back to county.
Day after tomorrow.
Should be a party.
They let me in.
They said you were
expecting me?
Yeah. I was.
A couple weeks ago.
The D.A.'s office told us not
to have any contact with you,
that it could hurt the case.
But you came anyway?
Well, I appreciate
what you did.
We all do.
Ambassador of the group,
just passing on the message.
What do you want me to say?
Nothing.
You said your piece.
You're good to go.
All right, well,
just make sure that gets filed tonight,
and send me the e-mail,
and I'll look over it.
Thanks... Thanks, Rachel.
I'll, uh...
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
Hey there.
Hey.
You, uh...
You said "dinner."
You didn't say that
you were decorating.
Champagne?
Mm-hmm. Take this.
Give me this.
Thank you.
Ed, what is...
What is all this?
We've been at this
for four years now.
We've danced around each other.
We've gone full throttle,
half throttle.
Sometimes I wanted
to throttle you.
But something happened to
me when I got the call
that you were one of the
people inside that bank,
when I had to confront the possibility
of living the rest of my life without you.
Two days later,
when you came walking out
of there and back to me...
I promised myself that I would
never risk losing you again.
I'm sorry. I'm... Excuse me.
Now if you're not gonna
take the injured guy,
you're not gonna take the girl,
take her. What's your name?
Na-Nancy Hale.
Take Nancy. She's the oldest.
That's gonna win you
points out there.
Besides, she's been driving you
crazy since this whole thing started.
Tie me up if you want to,
handcuff me.
But keep me in here.
Showtime, lady. Let's go!
I'm so sorry I called you.
You shouldn't even be here.
It's all right, mom.
Get back.
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine, okay?
She's coming out.
First she rings the stuff back,
hands if off at the door,
then we let her go.
You got that?
Wait a minute.
She needs her purse.
She needs her purse.
Just give me one minute...
Katie! Let her go!
Mom, mom!
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine!
No, let her go!
Mom, you're gonna be fine!
Let her go. Let her go!
Let go of me!
One more word out of you, lady!
One more word!
Don't do this to me!
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.
Don't do this to me!
She can't hear you.
It's okay.
Tell  me what's happening.
It's okay. She's going.
Everything's fine.
She's almost there.
She's being very brave.
What the hell is she doing?
Now what?
Everything is fine.
She's just getting the stuff.
No.
No...
No, Katie!
No, no, no! What the hell?
Please, let me go!
What the hell?
What is happening?
Stay with me!
You've got to let me go, please!
God!
It's okay. They've got her.
They've got her. It's fine.
Don't!
She's okay. She's fine.
She's safe. She's safe.
I'm sorry to call
you in on a Saturday.
If you would renew my prescription
over the phone, then I would...
Well, I thought this was a
nice opportunity to catch up
since I haven't heard
from you in over a mon.
Anything big happen?
Lydia, look, I already told you,
I don't want to talk about the bank.
I don't want to talk about anything.
I just need more Zenatan.
Kathryn...
What's going on?
Ed proposed to me last night.
Or  tried to, and then I...
I couldn't breathe.
He started to say the words,
and I just... I couldn't...
I couldn't get any air.
And what happened?
I hid in the bathroom until
I was calm and then...
By the time I came
out to apologize...
Ed was incredibly understanding
as always, and he just...
I don't know,
he said we could table it.
So things are...
Yeah, back to normal,
whatever that means.
Have you been having the
attacks again since the bank?
No, actually that...
that one was the first.
So what we're saying is,
bank trauma, no problem,
marriage proposal, big problem?
It's not marriage.
Then what? Is it Ed?
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.
There is someone from the bank.
I've only known him
for a couple weeks,
but I've been
thinking about him,
which is so ridiculous,
because I've known Ed for four years!
And I go through this thing with
this guy for two days, and I...
Well, let's be honest.
You've always been ambivalent about Ed,
and I never thought it had
anything to do with Ed.
But that's the thing...
since the bank,
I have been open to Ed and needing Ed.
And it's been okay.
But then there's this other man.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hey Franny, how's it going?
It's Jeremy.
Hey, what's up?
I was just checking in to see
if you got invited to that
poker game over at
Nick's tonight.
Yeah, Egan called,
but I don't really play cards,
though, so... I don't know.
Yeah, same here.
there's this party over at my
neighbor's house. It's a charity thing.
He's a music industry guy.
I think it'll be pretty fun.
I was, well, wondering if you'd want to go.
Um, sure.
That'd be cool.
All right.
Well, it starts around 10:00.
I was thinking that maybe I could
pick you up around 8:00 and, uh...
and we could grab
some dinner first,
unless you wanted to
just meet me there.
No, no, no.
Dinner would be great.
Okay, great.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks again for doing this.
It means a lot to her.
Hey, it's a step up from the diner.
Oh, I'm supposed to say hello from Egan.
He's, uh,
pretty devastated you're not
coming to this thing tonight.
Thank you.
Poker, huh?
Yeah.
No, I-I just was a little surprised. I
didn't think that you did that anymore.
Look, whatever you heard
from Ed was overstated.
Thank you.
I  had a bad period last
year after my divorce.
I made a few mistakes, played with
some people I shouldn't have, but
that's it. It's over.
Anyway, it was Egan's idea.
We're playing for nickels.
You should come.
Oh, I am so sorry.
The driver insisted on taking the 405.
Oh, well.
Ah, good.
Thank you, Enrique.
We'll have the champagne now.
Oh, mom,
that's not really necessary.
Well, you're not on duty, are you?
Nope. Day off.
Good, then I insist. I'm appallingly
overdue in paying tribute to this
man's heroism,
and I intend to do so properly.
You know, I'm not sure I deserve to be...
I will havene of your modesty.
You were coolheaded and shrewd,
certainly more so than those
flak-jacketed brutes that
dragged me off the plaza.
Aha, here we are.
Oh, this is lovely.
Yeah? Well...
Thank you.
To detective Nicholas Cavanaugh,
who saved my life,
and to my daughter Kathryn,
who is finally beginning hers.
What are you talking about?
Oh, dear.
Did things not go
as planned? I...
I'm sorry. Did I miss something?
Mother, mother, mother,
we'll discuss it later.
They have a great
crab salad here.
Don't take me!
Don't come near me!
You understand?
Because they're gonna
shoot my daughter in there
if you come near me in any way!
Trojans beat Oregon!
I can smell the roses. Come on,
let's go to the homecoming rally.
No, I gotta finish this book.
You know, you used to beg me to take you
to those things when I'd take
your brothers.
You'd even do the Trojan cheer for me.
Yeah, I was like 10.
Honey, you have had your
nose in this thing all day.
It's time for you to take
a break with your old man.
If you're nice to me,
I'll give you a sip of my beer.
What about mom?
I forwarded all the calls to my cell phone.
Get your shoes on.
Let's go, come on!
It's not like I'm asking for a
penthouse, a house in bel-air.
For 2 grand a month, a person should
be entitled  some light, some space.
The one in century city wasn't bad.
It was century city adjacent at best.
How about the one in north Hollywood?
That had plenty of light.
Right on the 134?
All the noise, the pollution?
Egan, it's not like you're
gonna retire there.
No, but I might want to
entertain occasionally.
You know, maybe get a regular
poker game going, huh?
You'd better hurry.
There's a car coming at 6:00.
You know, I just want to know
why my mother casually let it drop that
we were celebrating my engagement.
Well, that must have been
awkward given the circumstances.
I mean, what did you do,
ask for my hand in marriage
when you know how I feel about my
mother? I mean, what is this, the '50s?
Were the two of you
working out my dowry?
Right, your mother...
that's the issue here.
No, Ed, the issue is
that it's more important to you
that everybody thinks you're swell
than it is to show me fundamental
respect and consideration.
"Respect and consideration"?
You know, it makes me wonder.
I mean, do you have any idea who
I am or what it is that I want?
You don't know what you want,
which is why you came over
here to pick a fight with me,
so you don't have to deal with yourself.
Don't put this on me.
No, this one's all you.
Now, I love you, Kat.
You know I do.
But I put myself out there,
and you literally ran away.
Now putting my feelings aside... which,
by the way, is kind of a pattern here...
putting my feelings aside, you need
to get clear on what you're doing,
because if we're not moving forward,
I don't know where we're going anymore.
You can let yourself out.
Do you usually go to the bathroom this much?
I'm nervous.
Yeah, well,
I can't keep walking you back here.
This is the last time.
I'm pregnant.
That's why.
Don't let Randall find out.
I won't.
I mean it.
It won't be good
if he finds out.
Just trust me.
And nobody else should
find out either.
And tell your boyfriend not to say anything.
He won't.
He doesn't know yet.
What's your name?
Thank you, Lucas.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, it's okay.
Uh, I was just headed out.
Cologne?
Yeah, I gotta go to
this charity thing.
You have a date?
I thought it was a little
too soon for full disclosure.
No, it is... too soon.
Well, I'm running late.
I should go.
Have a good time.
Do you have an open seat?
You're the first one here.
Where is everyone?
Egan's out getting ice or,
uh, guacamole.
Can I get you something?
Uh, yeah,
I'll take one of those bad boys. Thanks.
I thought you had
a thing with Ed.
Yeah, last-minute
change of plans.
Lucky for us.
You see something you want to put on?
Uh, you pick.
I didn't know you had a sister.
That's my ex-wife.
Wow, she's really pretty.
It's a good picture of my mom.
Ed... Ed proposed to me.
Wow.
Was that the, uh,
second half of your mom's toast?
Yeah, apparently.
Good for you.
Well, I haven't answered him yet.
Really?
But he's a good guy.
Well, I'm kind of
a commitment-phobe.
Aren't we all?
Kathryn Hale! Hey!
Hey! Hi.
My evening is complete.
Hey, and look who I found outside.
Hey, there.
Hey, you made it with
the whole family.
Yep, well,
I figure she's off to college soon.
She might as well learn
how to play cards, right?
And gene's coming, too.
We're gonna have a full house.
Egan, I cannot get enough of
this guacamole. What is in this?
Some call it cilantro.
I call it fiesta. Call.
2 pair. Kings and 7s.
Trip 6s. Is this good?
Let me see. You got four, no,
five jacks with a wild card.
Honey, that means you won.
You're a natural-born genius.
All right, here we go.
Get your money, babe.
Sweet innocence.
It's your mother.
Sit out the next hand.
Um, hey, honey.
Come on, Egan. It's your deal.
Um, we're just, uh,
taking it easy, you know?
Lying to the wife about poker.
Very old-school.
No, it's not lying.
It's bluffing.
Hey, she's learning.
Very nice.
Okay, uh, 7-card stud. Ante up.
And deuces, one-eyed jacks wild.
Oh, come on.
Playing with two wild
cards is not poker.
Who's up for a
round of hold'em?
$5, $10 blinds.
Cavanaugh's getting restless.
All right.
I'm sorry I was out of
line with you before.
scared about everything I have to face.
I know.
I guess you are, too.
I don't know what I am lately.
It all got turned upside down,
Yeah.
Can I get you anything?
It is your last night.
You could sit with me.
I am really sorry for dragging
you to that thing. Those people...
Somehow I don't think they were
all there for animal rescue, huh?
You think?
Did you see that one lady
in the leather pantsuit?
I mean, come on.
How many cows do you think were
killed to make that thing?
Oh, wait.
You said "pantsuit."
Who says "pantsuit"?
Pantsuit. My mother
used to wear those.
You are such a white boy.
Do that dance move
for me again.
What, do you mean this one?
Oh, no.
I had a really
good time tonight.
Me, too.
This is the most...
uncomplicated I've
felt in a long time.
Are we really doing this?
Nick's got cards.
Scared.
Not yet.
Call.
Calling and flopping.
Two ladies showing.
Check.
Do you think they changed on you?
I'm jumping off this train, boys.
You can't handle it.
10 and raise 10.
Check, raise. Very sly.
Too hot for me.
I'm getting out of the kitchen.
What do you have, my friend?
Well, there is one more queen
besides the one in your hand,
and I think I have the better kicker.
Your thoughts, milady?
You can hang.
Here goes nothing.
Fourth street.
I think you're bluffing.
Then raise me.
I will.
Reraise.
Raise you back.
This is a rush.
What do you say we go no limit?
Bring it on, my friend.
Guys, come on. What are you doing?
We're playing cards.
$240. I'm all in.
All right. Um...
I got $180 on the table.
Um, do you accept cash?
Why not?
All right, let's see...
This is ridiculous.
Okay, alpha dogs.
Let's see 'em.
Three sisters.
I hit my straight. Sorry, bud.
Whoa...
Wow. Burned by lady luck.
I should have known.
I'm playing with a shark.
Wait a minute, you were...
You were betting on a straight draw?
I got my lucky 7.
Yeah, but that
was the last card.
I mean, you should have
dropped out after the flop.
You had nothing, and you kept on raising?
I was bluffing.
Yeah, but you knew
had three queens.
I won the hand, didn't I?
Is there a problem?
No, no, no. It's...
it's fine. Whatever.
Uh, anyone up for some more,
uh, guacamole?
There was this card
game last night
and there was this moment
where he won this
really big hand,
and there was just something
about it that made me snap.
How do you mean?
I don't know. I got...
I got really angry.
I don't know why.
He could have lost everything,
and then he just happened
to get the right card.
And maybe that's great card-playing,
It's like this guy is
willing to bet everything
on a wing a prayer and just
kind of hope it works out?
I mean, this is crazy!
What was I even doing there?
What do you think you were doing there?
I don't know.
I'm wondering why this is
suddenly so urgent for you.
Well, because Ed is...
Well, he's kind of thrown
down the gauntlet.
I-I think I've, uh...
I've finally pushed
him to his limit.
So... this may be
a fork in the road?
I don't know what's
wrong with me.
Why am I resisting someone that
I have loved for four years,
who has been there for
me again and again?
Well, you and Nick went through
something incredibly powerful together.
It's not easily dismissed.
Yeah.
I used... I used to take these walks on
the beach when I was kid, and I would...
I would pick up the brightest shells,
the ones
with the strongest greens
and purples and reds.
And then when I got home, I'd put them
on the windowsill, and they just...
I don't know.
They seemed pale and dusty,
you know, like they couldn't...
They couldn't survive
outside the saltwater.
Is that how you
feel about Nick?
That he can't survive
out in the world?
That what we had inside the bank
won't survive outside in the world.
Hey!
Do not move.
Cuff the post first.
That's fine. Now me.
That's fine. Not so tight.
I'm sorry.
Thanks for speaking up before
about keeping me in. It helped.
You... move!
I think we all feel
better having you here.
All right, come on.
Morning.
Hey, uh, sorry. I was hoping to
finish by the time you got up.
No sweat. It's been worse.
There's coffee.
Are you, uh,
actually going to
apply to this hellhole?
Oh, I wouldn't call
it a hellhole.
More like a mousehole.
Look, this is ridiculous.
Take back the money.
I'm not taking the money.
I don't want it.
You won it fair and square!
I was an ass last night, okay?
I pushed you into it.
I wasn't pushed.
I was playing poker.
It was actually surprisingly thrilling,
worth every penny,
and if you keep trying to
give me back the money,
then I am gonna
feel like the ass.
Oh, Nick, come on.
You just paid your
first month's rent.
Keep looking for a place,
but in the meantime,
stick around...
If you don't mind the couch.
Thank you.
You know,
you're the only
one who knows...
What happened between
me and Jeremy.
You haven't talked
to anybody about it?
I haven't even talked
to him about it.
There's really nothing
between us now but... silence.
And a child.
What happens when someone's pointing
a gun at you is not who you are.
I can tell you that.
Hey.
Hey.
I let myself in.
How was the mayor?
Mayoral.
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
I'm sorry I've been
such an idiot.
I guess you've been reconsidering the
part about not wanting to lose me twice.
Well, maybe I never had you.
Eddie, I been thinking about it a lot,
I know I have been all over the place,
but for what it's worth,
I feel clear now, and...
I know that you probably feel
that you can't trust that, but...
I want you to try.
What does that mean, "try"?
Will you do me the honor of finishing
what you were asking me the other night?
Please.
I wasn't planning on doing
this in my underwear.
Kathryn Hale...
Will you marry me?
Oh, my god.
That ring, that's...
That's my grandmother's ring.
Where did you get that?
Ah, your mother, god bless her,
said to me very early on
that if I ever wanted to take
things to the next level,
she had the ring.
So last week,
I called her and
said I was ready.
Ooh. What's that for?
It's good to have you home.
Oh, I should go away more often.
What'd you and Felicia do?
That girl is positively sparkling.
Well, nothing special.
Just a good time with her dad.
Not too many left before
she's off to college.
So you, uh,
ever hear back from the alarm company?
Oh, yeah, they came by. Said it was
a broken window sensor or something.
So they fixed it?
Supposedly.
'Cause I don't want Ms.
Fisher to start complaining.
Where are my keys?
Honey, you seen my keys?


But what about Jean?
What about her illness?
Illness?
John.
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.
Of course.
Jean, can you come down, dear?
We'll leave you, then.
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.
Really? I doubt that.
Oh, Charles.
I like this one.
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.
The question is, will you
control that power?
Or let it control you?
Warren? Son, is everything all right?
What's going on?
Nothing. I'll be right out.
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.
Open the door. Warren.
One second!
Open this door.
Warren.
Let me in there right now. Open the door.
Oh, God.
Not you.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Not you.
Dad, I'm sorry.
The whole world's going to hell and
you're just going to sit there? Let's go.
Bobby!
We're getting killed out here.
Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.
Logan.
Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.
That was my last cigar.
Logan.
It's getting closer.
Come on. Let's keep moving.
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.
How's your throwing arm?
Logan, we work as a team.
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.
Class dismissed.
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.
Simulation complete.
What was that?
Danger room session.
You know what I mean.
Lighten up.
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.
I taught 'em something.
It was a defensive exercise.
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?
This isn't a game, Logan.
Well, you sure fooled me.
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.
Scott!
Jean.
Scott. Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
Are you OK?
I'm fine.
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.
They were looking for you. You
didn't show. - What do you care?
For starters, I had to cover your ass.
I didn't ask you to.
No, you didn't. The professor did.
I was just passing through.
So pass through, Logan.
Hey, look.
I know how you feel. When Jean died...
Don't.
Maybe it's time for us to move on.
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.
Mr. Secretary.
Yes.
The meeting's begun, sir.
Thank you.
Mr. President.
Have a seat, Hank.
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.
Yes, sir. She can do that.
Not any more, she can't. We got her.
You think your prisons can hold her?
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.
Where is Magneto?
Raven?
Raven, I asked you a question.
I don't answer to my slave name.
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?
In here with us.
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.
You don't want to play games with me?
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?
You wanna know where he is?
Homo sapien.
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.
I thought that's why you
appointed me, sir. - Yes, it is.
But that's not why you called me here.
No. This is.
It's what she stole from the FDA.
Dear Lord.
Is it viable?
We believe it is.
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.
When an individual acquires great power,
the use or misuse of that
power is everything.
Will it be for the greater good or will it be
used for personal or for destructive ends?
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.
Why? Because we are mutants.
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern
without any superhuman authority behind it.
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,
say a father of four with terminal cancer,
into the body of this man?
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...
Professor?
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.
The forecast was for sunny skies.
I'm sorry.
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.
Yes, but we can't be students forever.
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.
But Scott's...
Scott's a changed man.
He took Jean's death so hard.
Yes, things are better out there,
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.
There's something you're not telling us.
Ororo. Charles.
I love what you've done with your hair.
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.
I have news.
Is it Eric?
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.
Mystique was recently apprehended.
Who's the fur ball?
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.
Henry, this is Logan. He's...
Wolverine.
I hear you're quite an animal.
Look who's talking.
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.
Suppress?
Permanently.
They're calling it a cure.
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.
Scientifically speaking...
When did we become a disease?
Storm.
They're announcing it now.
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I proudly present the answer to mutation.
Finally, we have a cure.
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take itjust to fit in?
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?
Not all of us can fit in so easily.
You don't shed on the furniture.
The government probably cooked this up.
The government had nothing to do with it.
I've heard that before.
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant
rights since before you had claws.
Did he just call me boy?
Is it true? They can cure us?
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.
No. Professor.
They can't cure us.
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.
Or any of us, for that matter.
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...
They wanna exterminate us.
This cure is voluntary.
Nobody is talking about extermination.
No one ever talks about it.
They just do it.
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,
the extermination has already begun.
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.
They will force their cure upon us.
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?
Who will you stand with? The humans?
Or us?
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.
Back off.
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.
You know who you're talking to?
Do you?
And what can you do?
So you have talents?
That and more. I know you control metal.
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.
Other than you two.
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?
Could you locate one for me?
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.
Oh, Mr. President.
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.
Please.
Keep it up. I'll spray you
in the face, bitch.
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.
Yeah, right.
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.
We are in compliance with your policy.
How long will you keep the boy here?
Until we can fully map his DNA. We can
replicate it, but we can't generate it.
And his power? What is its range?
You'll see.
There's someone I would like you to meet.
Hello there, son.
My name is Hank McCoy.
I'm sorry.
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.
Extraordinary, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
Stop.
I'm here. Scott. Scott.
Stop it.
Scott. Scott.
Stop it.
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.
Stop!
Jean?
Scott.
How?
I don't know.
I wanna see your eyes.
Take these off.
No.
No.
Trust me. I can control it now.
Open them. You can't hurt me.
What happened?
No clue.
Professor, are you OK?
Get to Alkali Lake.
You don't want to be here.
Do you?
I can't see a damn thing.
I can take care of that.
What the...
Logan!
She's alive.
Jean.
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.
The only explanation of Jean's survival
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.
Is she gonna be OK?
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've
ever encountered, her potential limitless.
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.
Jean developed a dual
personality. - What?
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.
She knew all this?
It's unclear how much she knew.
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,
or the Phoenix furiously
struggling to be free.
She looks peaceful to me.
I'm keeping her that way.
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.
What have you done to her?
You have to understand...
You're talking about a person's mind.
She has to be controlled.
Controlled?
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.
It sounds to me like Jean
had no choice at all.
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.
History will be made here today.
For the first time,
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.
Some are desperate for this cure while
others are offended by the very idea of it.
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.
Good. Bring him in.
Are you sure you want to start with him?
I think it's important. Yes.
Hello, Warren.
How are you, son?
Did you sleep well?
Yeah.
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.
You ready?
The transformation can be a little jarring.
Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
We've talked about it, son.
It'll all be over soon.
Everything's going to be fine.
Wait. I can't do this.
Warren, calm down.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
I can't do this.
Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.
I promise you it will be fine.
Warren, relax. - Dad.
Warren, it's a better life.
It's what we all want.
No.
It's what you want.
Warren, no!
Told you so.
About time.
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.
Without him, they have nothing.
Read off the guest list.
Cell 41205. James Madrox. 
This one robbed seven banks.
At the same time.
I could use a man of your talents.
Welcome to the Brotherhood.
Careful with this one.
Cain Marko. Solitary confinement. 
Check this out.
Prisoner must be confined at all times. 
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him. "
How fascinating.
What do they call you?
Juggernaut.
I can't imagine why.
Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.
Nice helmet.
Keeps my face pretty.
I think he'll make a fine
addition to our army.
No!
You saved me.
Eric.
I'm sorry, my dear.
You're not one of us any more.
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?
I have.
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.
As do I.
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.
Jean.
Hi, Logan.
Welcome back.
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
More than OK.
Logan, you're making me blush.
You're reading my thoughts?
I don't have to.
No.
Jean.
This isn't you.
Yes, it is me.
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.
The professor said you might be different.
He would know, wouldn't he?
What? You think he's not in your head too?
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.
Where's Scott?
Jean?
Where am I?
You're in the mansion.
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.
Jean, tell me what happened to him.
Oh, God.
Look at me.
Stay with me. Talk to me.
Look at me. Look at me.
No.
Focus. Focus, Jean.
Kill me.
Kill me before I kill someone else.
Don't say that.
Please.
Stop it.
Kill me.
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.
It'll be all right. We can help you.
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.
I don't want to fix it.
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.
I told you they would draw first blood.
So what do we do?
What do we do?
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.
Come. We have an army to build.
I picked something up.
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.
More powerful than you.
Where is she?
Logan.
Jean. Jean.
What happened?
What have you done?
I think she killed Scott.
That's not possible.
I warned you.
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.
It may be too late.
Wait for me here.
I need to see Jean alone.
You were right, Charles.
This one is special.
What the hell are you doing here?
Same as the professor.
Visiting an old friend.
I don't want trouble here.
Nor do I.
So, shall we go inside?
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.
Just like old times, eh?
She needs help. Jean is not well.
Funny, you sound just like her parents.
Nobody gets inside.
I knew you'd come.
Of course. I've come to bring you home.
I have no home.
Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.
So you want to control me?
He does.
No. I want to help you.
Help me? What's wrong with me?
Absolutely nothing.
Eric, stop.
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.
For your own good, Jean.
Stay out of my head.
I'm going in.
The professor said he'd handle this.
Look at me, Jean. I can
help you. Look at me.
Get out of my head.
Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.
But I can help you.
I think you want to give her the cure.
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.
No! Stop it!
Jean, let me in.
No, Jean.
Jean!
Don't let it control you.
Charles.
My dear. Come with me.
No.
God!
We live in an age of darkness.
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.
A world he tried to heal.
A mission he never saw accomplished.
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.
And that's a vision of a world united.
Bobby.
You OK?
Yeah.
It's just... Xavier came to my house.
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.
Yeah, me too.
We're all feeling the same way, you know.
No, Bobby, we're not.
You have Rogue and I have...
You know, I just miss home.
The first snow and all that.
Kitty, get up. Come with me.
Storm told us to stay in our rooms.
Don't worry. We won't get caught.
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.
Come on.
This place can be home too.
Thank you for this, Bobby.
You need a lift, kid?
No.
Where are you going?
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.
Yeah, I do.
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.
A hug. A handshake.
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.
Look, if you wanna go, then go.
Just be sure it's what you want.
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?
To go upstairs and unpack?
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.
Just think about what I said, Rogue.
Marie.
Marie.
Remember when we first met? Do you
know what I saw when I looked at you?
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"
I can manipulate the metal in this,
but you, you can do anything.
Anything you can think of.
Jean.
Enough.
Enough.
You sound just like him.
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.
What do you want?
I want you to be what you are.
As nature intended.
That cure is meant for all of us. If we
want freedom, we must fight for it.
And that fight begins now.
She shouldn't be here with us.
Her power is completely unstable.
Only in the wrong hands.
And you trust her? She's one of them.
So were you once.
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.
So what now? What do we do?
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.
We'll tell the students they're going home.
Most of us don't have anywhere to go.
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.
It was, son.
And it still is. We'll find you a room.
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.
Rogue.
Hey, Rogue.
Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
Yeah, she took off.
Logan.
Logan.
Logan.
Jean?
Logan. Where am I? Logan.
Logan. Logan.
Logan.
Stop.
Logan. Logan. Logan.
Where are you going?
Where do you think?
She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
You don't know that.
She killed the professor.
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.
Listen, why can't you see the truth?
Why can't you just let her go?
Because... because...
Because you love her.
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.
So if you're with us, then be with us.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?
I'm looking for someone.
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.
I figured she'd want the
cure. She's pathetic.
Come on, Iceman.
Make a move.
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.
Today's attack was only our first salvo.
So long as the cure exists,
our war will rage.
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...
Join us or stay out of our way.
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.
We cannot let him do this.
You know I agree, sir.
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.
Let's go. Keep it moving.
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.
Absolutely no metal.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.
The cure for that infirm, imperfect
condition called homo sapiens.
They have their weapons.
We have ours.
We will strike with a vengeance and a
fury that this world has never witnessed.
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,
take control of the cure,
and destroy its source.
And then nothing can stop us.
Jean.
I know the smell of your adamantium
from a mile away.
I didn't come here to fight you.
Smart boy.
I came for Jean. - You think
I'm keeping her against her will?
She's here because she wants to be.
You don't know what you're dealing with.
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.
And you stood there and let him die?
I'm not leaving here without her.
Yes, you are.
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.
How did we find it?
She gave us everything we wanted.
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
Approaching target dead ahead.
Set for 360-degree incursion.
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.
OK, send them in.
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!
OK. I give up.
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.
If he's not there, then
where the hell is he?
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.
Are you sure the boy is still inside?
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.
Leave that to me.
Storm. Storm.
What are you doing back here?
I need help.
You found her.
Yeah. She's with Magneto.
Where are they?
On the move. I know where they're going.
You're saying you saw Magneto?
We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.
There are troops stationed on that island.
Not enough to stop him.
Let's suit up.
Hard to believe this once fit me. - If
Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.
Can you estimate how many he has?
An army. And Jean.
His powers have limits, hers do not.
There's only six of us, Logan.
Yeah. We're outnumbered.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
But we lost Scott.
We lost the professor.
If we don't fight now, everything
they stood for will die with them.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Are you?
Then we stand together.
X- Men.
All of us.
We're in.
Let's go.
They're ready.
Yeah, I know.
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?
Dad, what's going on?
It's an earthquake.
We're trapped.
Charles always wanted to build bridges.
My God.
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.
Well, then.
Let's take it down!
In chess, the pawns go first.
Humans and their guns.
Plastic. They've learned.
That's why the pawns go first.
Target the bridge.
Fire!
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.
Oh, my stars and garters.
Go into stealth mode.
What aboutjets? Tanks? - Against
Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.
Where are our ground troops?
30 minutes away.
Then God help us.
They're coming for him.
Don't ever do that again.
You men cover the doors!
Everybody get together! And hold this line!
Traitors to their own cause.
Finish them!
Not yet.
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.
With pleasure.
Hold it!
He's going for the boy!
Not if I get there first.
Come on.
Grow those back.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.
Going somewhere?
You're the guy that
invented the cure, right?
Yes, I am.
Girls.
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.
No. Don't hurt him.
Let go of me. I didn't do anything.
Calm down. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be OK.
I thought you were a diplomat.
As Churchill said, "There comes a time... "
Oh, you get the point.
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.
No.
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.
This way.
Oh, my God. What's going on?
Your powers won't work with me.
Stay close, all right?
I'm the wrong guy to
play hide-and-seek with.
Who's hiding, dickhead?
Don't. No.
Don't.
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.
Do we look like we need your help?
It's time to end this war.
Take cover.
Get out of the way.
Let's go, let's go.
Move.
Go! Go! Go!
We work as a team.
Best defense is a good offence.
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?
Go ahead.
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.
You're in over your head, Bobby.
Maybe you should go back to school.
You never should have left.
Hey.
Make it a strike.
You never learn, do you?
Actually, I do.
One of them?
This is what they want for all of us.
It's over, Jean.
It's over.
No! Don't shoot!
No!
Everybody get out of there!
Bobby!
What have I done?
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.
Go.
Jean!
Jean!
I know you're still there!
You would die for them?
No, not for them.
For you.
For you.
Save me.
I love you.
You're back.
I'm sorry.
I had to.
This isn't what I wanted.
I know.
It's what I want.
Hey.
Good to see you, buddy.
With the thanks of a grateful nation
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,
human and mutant alike,
Dr. Hank McCoy.
Way to go, fur ball.

Whoever listens to me
will make a fortune on this one.
Give me a break.
If you're such a big shot...
fiix the neon sign
you installed for me!
Old man, you know
I always fulfiill my obligations.
"Your obligations"!
I've already waited three months!
You have to understand...
there's been an increase
in the price of materials.
You're going to have to come up
with some more money...
to make the light operational.
Lie down!
The Way to Success
 Bathhouse
" Big Legs" has escaped!
Where'd he go?
There he is.
There he is.
Don't move, don't move.
Where?
There?
No, over here!
Older brother...
Where's Dad?
Erming...
Erming...
Erming, what does
this picture you sent me mean?
Dad's sleeping, and this is me.
Why did you send it to me?
I missed you.
You scared me.
I thought that Dad...
Do you concede defeat?
I'll beat you again tomorrow.
Hey, I'm not worried.
Tomorrow I'll bring Godzilla.
Bring him on!
Take care.
We'll see!
See you tomorrow.
You're back on business?
Uh, no.
I came to see you and Erming.
Can you still eat northern food?
Yeah, it's delicious.
Can you get
this kind of noodles down south?
Once in a while.
The sauce is no good, though.
How have you been?
All right.
I can eat,
I can sleep and I can work.
I sent him this!
Mr. Liu! Mr. Liu!
It makes me happy that you had
a chance to see your brother.
Relax. Loosen up.
Easy, easy.
There you go.
Ty the shoulder now.
Hey, much better!
You and your wife...
always coming to blows
over the littlest things!
No matter how nice I am,
she always beats on me!
Hey, Daming.
Is that you?
When did you come back?
Today.
Long time no see!
What brings you home?
I'll leave you guys alone.
See you tomorrow.
Mr. Liu, thanks so much.
Don't mention it.
Bye!
Let's go and change.
Hello. It's me.
Nothing serious.
Eveything's fiine.
I misunderstood.
I'll be home
in a couple of days.
Okay. Bye.
Want to race?
Race!
One, two...
three!
Erming, look!
I won!
That doesn't count!
Let's go.
Why don't you take a bath?
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
I can fiill the tubs.
I've gotten used to showers.
Done.
Good morning.
Oh, hi there.
Hey, how's eveyone?
Meet you inside?
Mr. Liu! Good morning.
Morning.
I don't believe this!
Cricket-fiighting this early?
Who's fiighting who?
Boss, he wants a back scrub.
I'll be right over.
That doesn't count!
Why not? I won.
Don't be a sore loser!
What have you been feeding him?
Nothing special.
Just tell the truth.
You fed him ant eggs,
didn't you?
I did not!
You didn't?
Then why is he so energetic?
I'm no fool!
Even Godzilla isn't that tough.
That kind of stamina is impossible.
I've been training him.
Bullshit!
He's on steroids!
If he were a swimmer, he'd be banned
from competition for four years!
You're the coach.
You'd be banned for a year!
Oh, you're the only one
who can win?
If you can't take losing,
don't play!
Are you saying
I'm afraid of you?
This type of conduct
is unsportsmanlike and immoral.
I'm not talking to you again.
Hear me?
I'm not going to play
with you anymore!
Who cares!
We'll just have a bath
to seal our victoy.
You should be ashamed of yourself
at your age, you cheater!
What's going on?
I've put up with your tricks
for long enough!
Okay, okay.
Look at the smug expression
on his face!
You'll get yours.
Hi, here for a bath?
I came to see you.
I didn't get a chance
to talk to you yesterday.
There's some things
we need to discuss.
I've got a new idea,
This is serious business.
I'll have fiifty hot-dog carts.
I'll set them up
on all the busiest street corners.
A hot dog and a soda
is a standard combination.
Ten yuan for a hot dog and soda.
Eveyone can afford it!
It's almost too easy!
I've been working
on the business plan for a year.
Each cart can do over 50,000 yuan
in business a year.
With 50 carts...
we're looking at about
3 million yuan in business a year.
I even have a name:
The Big Dog.
Each cart will have a " Big Dog" logo
and a good-luck charm.
What do you think?
Sounds good.
I'm a little short of money.
I have other ideas, even better than this one.
All I need is an investor.
All of these ideas
are moneymakers!
Oh, I forgot.
Your dad asked me to repair
the neon sign the other day.
The price has gone up.
He needs to add
another 1,200 yuan.
You're two seconds short
of the record!
Hezheng gave me an additional bill
for the neon sign: 1,200 yuan.
That little weasel!
He doesn't fiinish what he starts,
and he still thinks he can cheat me.
Think you can beat me?
Yeah!
One, two...
three!
I'll go buy
my ticket home tomorrow...
I won. I won!
Hi! Where are you off to?
We're going to a movie.
See you around.
Erming, lean back.
What are you yelling about!
Dad, I bought this for you.
Come and ty it out.
Get up, Erming.
Lean back, Dad.
This is a back massager.
Here's the remote control.
It feels great.
Yeah, great.
Thanks, son.
I'll go get my ticket now.
Go ahead.
I want to go too.
Let's go. Erming.
Come on, Erming.
Let's go.
Stop it! Erming!
What the hell are you doing?
Quit it, Erming!
I'm sory.
That's enough now.
Get out of here!
The next available ticket
is at 10:10 tomorrow morning.
That's fiine.
Please fiill out
the reservation form.
Please check to make sure
it's all correct.
He hasn't shown up, has he?
I'll keep looking.
Did you fiind him?
No.
Did you call the police?
Yes.
They'll fiind him.
Mr. Liu, don't wory too much.
All you can do is wait.
Have some water.
Hey, where are you going?
Go on, follow him!
Why are you following me?
Where are you going?
Where am I going?
I'm looking for my son!
I'll go with you.
You're not needed here.
Go away!
Go the hell back to Shenzhen.
You're his older brother.
Look what you've done!
If you aren't willing
to take care of him...
don't take him out with you!
You don't care about him at all.
Tell me, why the hell
did you come back? Why?
I came to see you.
You came to see if I was dead!
I know that you don't respect me
or what I do.
I've done this all of my life
and I do it well.
Evey time I see an old customer,
You want to do big things.
You want to make big money.
Go ahead!
Erming and I are fiine without you.
Why did you come back?
I've already lost one son.
I can't lose you both!
Closed
Open
Where did he go?
Who knows?
He came back covered with dirt.
At least you know that
he can fiind his own way home.
You won't need to wory
so much next time.
It's been so many years.
This is the fiirst time...
He's grown up now.
There will be more problems
like this.
These houses are the same as they were
when I was a kid. Nothing's changed.
They're much older now.
They don't even keep out
the rain anymore.
They just need to be fiixed up.
These houses are like old people.
No matter how hard
you ty to fiix them up...
they're still old.
They're still special.
This is where I've spent my life.
Go on inside.
You'll catch a cold!
Are you okay?
I'm fiine.
Master Liu!
Dad, take some medicine.
You'd better go see a doctor.
No. I'm fiine.
I've just got a cold.
Nothing serious.
Are we opening today?
Why not?
I'll be out in a minute.
Dad, get some rest.
Erming and I
will take care of eveything.
Good morning.
Are you taking over
for your dad?
No. He's not
feeling well today.
What's wrong with him?
He caught a bit of a cold
last night.
He ought to take
better care of himself.
He's not a young man.
I've kept the usual place
open for you.
Hello.
Stop! Stop singing!
You're making me crazy!
This is a public bath,
not a karaoke room!
If you want to practice
your terrible singing, go the hell home!
What are you doing!
Mr. Zhang!
Your wife is at the front door
cursing and looking for you!
Let her curse.
I'm staying right here!
You goddamn loser!
You think you're safe in there?
You think you've escaped?
You think I won't come in there
after you, don't you?
No! You don't have the balls!
You bastard!
You'd better never come out!
Let's see how life in the bathhouse is!
Fine!
Erming. Come over here.
Has she left yet?
I knew that she didn't have
the nerve to come in.
Where are my clothes?
Who took my clothes?
Give them back.
I gave them to her.
Who told you
to give them to her?
She did.
Goddamn bitch!
She needs a good whipping!
Yeah! A good whipping!
Dad, drink this
and get a good sweat going.
Sory I made you waste
your return ticket.
No problem.
I'm all right.
Go back home
and get back to work.
 Haircut
Shower
 Fire cups
 Massage
 Back scrub" " Pedicure
Don't buy more food
than you can cary.
All that food.
No wonder your shoulder hurts.
I bought two new crickets.
Wanna have a look?
No. I wouldn't dare!
Your crickets are so great.
What if I can't take
my eyes off them?
I'm not begging you.
What a sore loser!
You still can't admit defeat.
I can't believe
you have time for a bath.
I have some free time today.
Locker number three.
Okay. See you.
Right, talk to you later.
It's for real this time.
They've already had
a formal meeting.
By the end of October...
the whole district
is going to be torn down.
Be prepared.
Offiicial notifiication
should be vey soon.
Sory, I've got to go.
Will the three of you be bathing?
Yes.
He has to be here.
His car is parked outside!
Go check the bathroom.
Did you think you could hide?
Give me another couple of days.
Please!
We're gonna settle this now!
Please!
I'm not hiding from you.
I can't go outside like this.
Just let me get dressed!
Just give me two more days.
Stop it!
What's going on?
What do the three of you
think you're doing?
He owes me money.
That has nothing to do with me.
Right now, he's in my place
and he's my customer.
Inside these walls,
I'm responsible for him.
If you want to take a bath,
that's fiine.
If you want to start trouble,
that's not okay.
You're right.
We'll wait outside.
Listen, you little asshole...
if I don't get my money today,
you'll regret it big-time.
Let's go.
I think it's time
that you stopped dreaming...
and got a real job.
Take these 20,000 yuan
and take care of the problems at hand.
Thanks so much. I'm sory.
No problem.
I'll pay you back as soon as I have money.
Okay, get going.
Thanks a lot.
Dad, isn't it true that
this area is going to be torn down?
That's what they say.
They've been talking
about it for so long...
I don't know what to believe.
They're going to build
high-rise buildings here?
I heard it's a shopping mall.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
We'll take it one step at a time.
I can't stand it anymore!
She's on my back all the time.
I've had it!
I'm going to divorce her.
I mean it this time.
Is it okay if I live here
for a couple of days?
No problem.
Go grab your usual spot.
I'll go grab a bottle.
We'll have a drink
and talk about it.
What's the real problem
between you two?
I don't know how to say it.
I'm afraid you'll laugh.
It started two years ago.
She went to take a shower
at the public bath.
She wore the gold necklace I gave her.
She used to wear it evey day.
It was a wedding present I gave her.
As soon as she's naked,
along comes a thief.
The thief grabbed the necklace
from her and ran outside.
The thief thought that
there was no chance...
that a naked woman would chase him.
But guess what.
My wife did!
The street was packed with people.
No one had ever witnessed
a scene like that.
Imagine this:
A woman, totally nude...
yelling and chasing someone
down the street!
The thief never expected this
and practically froze with fright.
Running as he looked
over his shoulder...
the thief tripped over the curb.
My wife pounced on him,
grabbed the necklace and cursed him out.
Man, did word travel fast!
I heard about it right away.
You know what?
She came home and proudly
told me the stoy herself!
She thought she was a hero.
I was so mad I slapped her.
I told her that she had lost
the little face that our family had.
Shut the fuck up!
From then on,
our marriage has been in shambles.
You know,
in Northwest China...
there are some areas so dy...
it doesn't even rain once a year.
People don't bathe there.
It's not that they don't want to.
There's just not enough water.
The well is dried up.
Go home
and come back next week.
What do we do?
We only have two days.
Do we have any grain left?
Not much.
Barely enough to eat.
Go.
There is one special local custom.
Young girls must take a bath...
on the evening
before their wedding day.
That girl was Erming's mother.
I've got to be honest.
I can't get hard anymore.
Since then,
evey time I see her...
There's nothing I can do.
The only thing I can do
is get divorced.
Help me out with something.
Sure. What?
TakeJinhao out to dinner after work.
I have an idea.
How was dinner?
Great.
Go have a good hot bath.
I put some special medicine
into the pool.
It should take care of your problem.
Really?
I've tried eveything!
This medicine is vey special.
Hury up.
The water's getting cold.
All right.
Erming, let's go.
Dad, can I go with you guys?
Okay. Let's go.
Tired? Let's sit and talk.
You're out of shape.
You should exercise more often.
The doctor says that kid...
has a minor psychological problem.
He can't get up the nerve
to sing in front of people.
Are you going to sing or not?
If you can't sing, let other people
have their turn to rehearse.
Dad, I'll come back
to see you and Erming often.
I'm okay.
Don't take what I said
the other day too seriously.
I was angy.
Erming and I are fiine.
You have things to take care of
at your new home.
Next time, bring your wife back.
I'd love to meet her.
I beat the record!
Dad, let me scrub your back for you.
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.
Don't wory.
I'll be home soon.
Another two days.
Okay. Bye.
Dad, ready?
For a period of fiive months...
this specially constructed shell
will protect the beetle larva.
The shell will provide
the perfect environment for development.
After the larva is hatched...
there will be
a four-month development period.
The ugly larva will eventually grow...
into a beautiful beetle.
The body of the dead mother
lies by the side of the shell.
She has worked hard and
ultimately sacrifiiced her own life...
to ensure the life of her offspring.
She will forever lie
in a grave of her own construction.
The larva's destiny
is out of her hands.
A drought could make
all her work for naught.
The small beetle faces
the same dangers as the giant elephant.
Only time will tell...
if the fruit of her mother's labor
will survive the whims of nature.
darkness brings a heavy downpour...
refreshing the dry plain.
The plain is refreshed...
greatly increasing
the chance of survival...
for the fruit of a parent's labor.
We're not opening today,
Erming.
Stop working.
We're closed.
Erming!
Dad's gone.
Dad's not coming back.
He's dead!
Our dad is gone?
Erming!
What are you going to do?
They are going
to tear down this place anyway.
I'll take Erming to live with me.
I can't take him right away.
I've got to arrange things fiirst.
I've got to make sure that my wife
is prepared to accept the situation.
Erming could stay with us for a while.
We can take care of him.
No, that would be too much trouble.
What are you talking about, "trouble"?
We'd be happy to look after him.
I think that it would be better...
if he left this environment
for a while.
Don't wory.
I'll fiigure something out.
My dad gave me these.
they had to travel
to a faraway lake...
just to take a bath.
You can bring these
with you tomorrow.
Erming.
Yes, I'll be back
for him in two months.
Thanks vey much.
Don't wory.
We'll take good care of him.
Erming, please listen to the nurses.
I'll be back to pick you up soon.
Erming.
Good-bye.
What are you doing?
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone! Dad!
Erming.
Erming.
I didn't make my flight.
Dad passed away.
My father passed away!
I don't know.
Nothing seemed wrong.
I was about to scrub his back...
when you called.
He passed away
while I was talking to you.
It was so unexpected.
He had just told me...
to bring you back for a visit.
It happened so fast.
I still can't believe it.
Actually, he'd been sick
for a long time.
I had no idea.
There's something else
I need to tell you.
My brother's retarded.
I should have told you earlier.
I wanted to,
but I just couldn't.
I'm so sory.
Now my dad's gone.
What do we do about my brother?
I have to take care of him.
I want to bring him back, okay?
Hello?
Open
Erming, I'll scrub his back.
You go welcome our customers.
Good morning.
Come in!
Here's your tea.
What, no one to compete with?
Nobody plays
with crickets anymore.
Where's Mr. Wu?
I haven't seen him for a long time.
Didn't you hear?
All of his crickets got crushed!
How did that happen?
It's like this:
His neighbors were moving.
The movers knocked down his wall.
The wall crushed all his crickets.
He was so upset,
he got sick and hasn't gotten over it.
Want to race?
One, two, three!
Why are you worying about the light?
The whole street is being torn down.
Your dad always wanted
to have it working.
I had to make it light up once
before it was too late.
 Neighborhood Culture Party
Next, a round of applause
for "O Sole Mio"...
performed by Miaozhuang.
Are you going to sing or not?
Next! Next!
Where are you moving to?
Fangzhuang area.
That's not too bad.
I'm moving to Daxing.
Quite far from downtown, isn't it?
That's right.
Cricket-fiighting opponents
won't be that easy to fiind.
I've thought about it.
I'm not going to raise
any more crickets.
Why not?
You don't know?
Crickets can't survive
in multistoy buildings.
Really?
I'm serious.
I know someone who moved
to live in a high-rise last year.
Guess what.
As soon as they left
the ground floor...
all his crickets died!
If he had known,
he would have set them all free.
I didn't know.
Well, no more fun in the future.
Fun? I don't wory about that.
I wory about whether...
the new community
has a bathhouse.
If not, where will we go
to take a nice bath?
Am I right?
We bought a gas heater
and will install it in our new house.
Then we can take
romantic private showers at home.
Shut up! Romantic!
Taking a bath here
is a lot more luxurious.
Yeah! It's so nice and warm here
and there's so much laughter.
What are you doing?
He's crazy!
Are you out of your mind?
We're here to help with the move.
What are you doing?
Erming!
What's the matter?
We're just movers.
What's going on?
Erming! Erming!
Dad told me they were going...
to take a bath in a faraway lake.
This was a very special
and holy Tibetan lake.
The water not only washes
your body...
but also your soul.
The lake can cure all sorts
of physical and spiritual ills.
Anyone who is religious
must make a pilgrimage to the lake...
once in a lifetime.
The old woman and her granddaughter...
lived very, very far from the lake
and had to walk for many months.
Finally, the weather turned cold...
and the little girl thought that
she couldn't go any further.
She asked her granny,
'Are we almost there?"
Granny said, 'Almost. "
The little girl asked again...
Isn't it too cold to take a bath?
Granny said...
"This is a special kind of bath.
We can only make this pilgrimage
at certain times.
The next time won't be for 12 years.
I'm afraid I will no longer
be alive then.
We must reach the lake
before the end of this year. "
Sometimes a simple thing
like taking a bath can be so diffiicult!
I understand you don't want to leave...
but the bathhouse
is going to be torn down.
It's just like Dad leaving us.
You've got to face it.
It's hard for me too.
I've been vey selfiish
and never told my wife about you.
I'm not quite sure what she thinks.
But no matter what...
Commissioner. we can't encourage
false hope.
All of us have had to come to terms
with life here on Alpha.
Hope is the key to morale.
We should maintain it.
we should exploit it ruthlessly.
in order to achieve
what should be our sole objective -
going home.
Commissioner.
our priorities are survival
and the search
for an alternative place to live.
A return to Earth
is out of the question.
'Commander Koenig. sensors detect
a powered object approaching Alpha
'at speed three-point-seven-two.
range four-nine-zero-three.'
What kind of object?
Indications are that it is a manned
space craft. Commander.
Kano. when do we have a visual?
Estimated a minute.
Radio contact?
None. sir.
Keep all frequencies open.
Alan. Put Eagles 1 and 2 on a path
for immediate lift off.
I want to show every welcome.
And if they're hostile. sir?
You'll be the first to know.
Visual.
Data analysed and ready.
Let's have it.
unidentified powered object.
'Object will orbit Alpha position
at coordinates nine-zero-seven-nine.'
Still no contact?
None. sir.
Eagle 1?
Intercept space craft. Lift off.
Eagle 2. lift off.
Space craft flight unstable.
They're in trouble.
They're not going into orbit.
Distress signals?
None.
Follow it.
It's gonna crash.
Stand clear. Eagles 1 and 2.
Paul. order a crash unit
to Launch Pad Three immediately.
Call Carter. I want him to fly it.
Yes. sir.
Tell Professor Bergman
to meet us there.
Kano. any readings of life signs?
Negative. Commander.
Paul. get security to join us.
Dr Russell. I'd like you to come.
Koenig. I think I'd better come too.
Commissioner. I need a doctor and
a scientist there. not a politician.
Carter here. we'll be lifting off
in five seconds.
All set?
I can't believe it's just chance.
No. they picked us out. John.
A deliberate landing on Alpha. They
must know what they're looking for.
I wish we knew.
Looks like some kind of a hatch
on the port side. Commander.
I'll put her down.
see if I can get a connection.
Confirm complete contact. sir.
Vacuum chamber
is ready for entry.
I'm returning Eagle to standby.
Launch Pad One.
Victor?
Any signs of life?
The atomic structure
of the metal is very dense.
certainly no movement I can see.
Kano. can you get us
the spectro X analysis?
Spectro X. Commander.
'Internal atmosphere zero.
lunar gravity.'
Helena. decompress.
Victor.
Looks like a central locking point.
Suspended animation?
Could be.
All right. we've got to start
somewhere.
Tony. go back to the ship.
bring back some lights
and Dr Russell's equipment.
Paul. activate gravity control
and atmosphere.
You have gravity and atmosphere.
Commander.
I hope they know what they're doing.
None of us knows for sure.
Commissioner.
Koenig could be in danger.
why is there no visual linkup?
Hold on. we're all breaking
our necks for a look.
Visual coming up now. Commissioner.
EKG and EEG both negative.
'There's absolutely
no indication of life.'
'If it was suspended animation.
maybe the crash killed them.'
no brain activity?'
None as far as I can tell
from radio microanalysis -
the skin tissue
shows no evidence of cell growth.
Who were they?
Where did they come from?
We can't learn any more
without breaking this seal.
We've taken every possible
precaution.
There's nothing else we can do.
Right. let's do it.
Stand by for biochemical analysis.
Main Mission standing by.
All our instruments indicated
that life no longer existed.
Yes. we were convinced of it.
Only then did we break the seal.
Come on. come on.
what the hell's the delay?
Maybe they don't live by lunar time.
Commissioner.
Paul. have the crash unit stand by.
'They're going to fly the spaceship
in on half power.'
Maintenance crew
prepare to receive alien spaceship.
Security. stand by travel tube
to alien spaceship
and prepare for visitors.
Excuse me.
Well. Koenig?
I think you should introduce us.
Captain Zantor.
Commissioner Simmonds.
Your status. please.
I represent Earth authority
here on Moonbase Alpha
may I say. welcome.
You represent Earth authority?
Yes.
And may I first assure
you that those responsible for the
regrettable loss of your crew member
will be brought to account.
Commissioner. I take responsibility.
Yes. you must.
as operational commander.
We realise that the mistake
which destroyed our comrade
was from ignorance. not malice.
We do not require judicial revenge.
Captain. as soon as
you've refreshed yourselves.
I suggest we meet
to discuss our situation.
Dr Russell will see you
to your quarters.
Be careful. Koenig.
They may not be as friendly
as they seem.
Please accept these gifts as peace
tokens from the people of Kaldor.
The libra bird was our symbol
of peace and freedom.
But. like everything else on our
planet. it ultimately became sterile.
When we left.
there were only two surviving pairs.
And their eggs.
when filled with gold.
were greatly prized as memorials
to our fading life.
Thank you. Captain.
We accept your gifts.
May I ask how long
you've been travelling?
Approximately three and a half
of your centuries.
Our planet was dying.
Our people sent out many ships.
One to each planet we believed
could sustain our kind of life.
And your ship was programmed
to land on this moon?
Only to orbit this moon.
Then we would reanimate and prepare
for the final stage of our journey.
to your planet. Earth.
You know our moon's
not in Earth's orbit?
Yes. I fear that random variations
in your trajectory and velocity
caused our computer to err.
And so we have crashed.
It's remarkable your computer
has found us at all.
It was so programmed.
How could it do otherwise?
Is your computer capable
of calculating the present
position of Earth?
Yes.
And it's programmed to reach Earth?
That is our prime directive.
It should be ours. too.
Unfortunately...some of us seem
to have lost the will to achieve it.
So your hope is to settle on Earth?
If we are welcome. yes.
But if you are not?
Then we would submit ourselves
to voluntary reduction.
In your terms.
we would take our own lives.
May I suggest that I run some tests
to determine if you and our people
on Earth are medically compatible?
I'll help to assess
the damage to your ship.
I'll leave you in their hands.
We are grateful.
My pleasure. Captain.
A symbol of peace and freedom.
Perhaps the impossible
doesn't take as long as we thought.
Their ship is bound for Earth.
Their computer is programmed
for going home. He just said so.
What are you suggesting?
Oh. come on. None of you
thought we had a chance. this is it.
All we need is the courage.
the vision...
and the leadership
to seize their ship.
And the Kaldorians?
Expendable.
Cryogenic deep freezing
we found to be inadequate
for suspended animation.
The deterioration of the body
can be slowed down.
but life itself
cannot be suspended in that way.
On Earth. you freeze food
to keep it fresh. do you not?
Yes. we do here.
But the flavour fades.
The problem's the same
all over the universe.
Exactly. The flavour
of life itself is lost.
But our process is different.
We have found a way
of accelerating energy
to create a cycle which holds
all the cell particles in stasis.
There is no reason why that process
should not be adapted to human use.
I find you sufficiently human.
Captain Zantor.
Then you will recommend
we continue our journey to Earth?
Yes.
Your beauty would be greatly enhanced
by suspended animation. Doctor.
Thank you.
To be perfectly at peace...
for seventy-five years.
That is the calculated time
it will take us to reach Earth.
Seventy-five years?
The time will pass like a dream -
Commander. with your approval
we wish to continue our journey.
In order to do that
we must repair the ship
and leave within 20
of your lunar hours.
It is impossible to reprogram
the computer from its directive.
Dr Russell?
They're medically clear.
Should you decide that we can go.
there will of course be
a vacant space on our ship.
So one of us can go home?
The similarities between us
are greater than the differences.
There is no reason why we should not
suspend animation for one of you.
Thank you. Captain.
it's a most generous offer.
Check out the process thoroughly
and let me know.
Koenig...
Captain Zantor. will you help
us set up the experiment?
I know. but if it'll work for one
it'll work for others.
Now seize their ship
and six of us can home.
Shut up. Given any thought
to what Earth will be like in 2074?
Whatever it's like. it's still
our home. Our natural home.
Simmonds. if that suspended animation
process works.
the computer will make an unbiased
choice of one passenger from Alpha.
You'll be eligible
like all the others.
Including yourself. of course.
No.
Look. I ought to be the one to go.
I have no place here on Alpha.
no function.
Believe me. if I could rig
that computer
it would shout out your name.
But you take
your chance like the rest.
Kano.
I want Computer to select one person
from Alpha to return to Earth.
The answer is to be confidential.
It'll take some time. Commander.
'John. serious emergency.
The spaceship. immediately.'
There was every reason
to believe it would work.
Both computers confirmed it.
Damn the computers!
She is not dead. Commander.
Her life cycle is suspended in time.
If you're so clever with life
and death. bring her out of it.
We're ready to try again.
Do you know what you're doing?
Captain Zantor is in charge.
It's not working.
Commander.
I had Kano run the Kaldorian data
through the computer.
The relative position of Earth.
It's that a way.
Seventy-five years.
What's that in miles?
Well. the computer passed that one
up. It's busy with other problems.
How are they doing?
The ship will be ready on schedule.
Commander.
What's happening inside?
Thank you.
Attention Commander Koenig.
'Commander. could you return to
the spaceship? We need your advice.'
Dr Russell is in a deeper sleep than
is right for the human metabolism.
Our mistake was to accept
your computer's profile of her.
Our mistake was to allow her
to try the experiment at all.
We overestimated your computer's
ability to analyse the human spirit.
It does not seem
to have understood it.
Does your computer understand it?
Oh yes.
But in reanimating
from so deep a sleep.
there is a danger
of cell damage to the brain.
The alternative is...death.
John. we must trust him.
Commander?
Go ahead. Captain.
Well. Captain?
Paul.
The spaceship
will be ready at 0900 hours.
So. one of us is going home.
Looks that way.
I have Computer's choice
for the return to Earth.
Well. I see you all want to go home.
I asked Computer to choose one name.
It's given me three. A classic case
of computer buck-passing.
Yes... Supposing you just
read the list.
No. I'm not decoding this
until Dr Russell convinces me
the process is absolutely safe
for us.
Well. I don't mind giving it a whirl.
Alan. even if it works
it won't be a picnic.
Seventy-five years is a long time.
Yeah. Keep talking. granddad.
Alan. we're not even sure
the Earth still exists.
Even if it does...
our families...
those we've loved...
won't be there any more.
Eight fifty-five. Paul.
Five minutes to go.
Have Captain Zantor come to see me.
Very good. sir. On his way.
You're supposed to be Commander.
You shouldn't have left that choice
to a machine.
The choice must be an objective one.
The choice is obvious.
As Commissioner I'm not part
of your team of experts.
My work is on Earth.
One word from you
and I can be on that spaceship.
I'll promise you only this.
If the computer chooses you.
you go with my blessings.
And if it doesn't?
Then you wave goodbye
with the rest of us.
No. I've been a politician
all my life.
I don't believe in chance.
Well... Welcome back
to the land of the living.
There remains only one question
to be decided. Commander.
Who is going
to accompany us to Earth?
Helena.
are you totally convinced it's safe?
We're beginning to understand it.
The process works
if the Captain's computer
has a matrix
of its human subject.
But if someone other
than Dr Russell were to go?
Then we shall have to make a matrix
of the individual you choose.
Goodbye.
Commander.
Kano.
I want Computer
to make the final choice.
One name.
Paul.
Commander?
Begin the countdown.
Victor. if Computer chooses you.
will you go?
I don't know.
Maybe I've had enough of Earth
and its so called civilisation.
What about you. Helena?
I don't know.
It is a nice idea.
Kano! Simmonds has my comlock.
Now. you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.
Simmonds went
to the Maintenance Section
and he's just entered
the Power Station.
Deactivate that comlock and have
Computer program another one for me.
Explain to the computer
as best you can.
Sandra. put me through
to the Power Station.
Simmonds. we have you on visual.
'You can come out peaceably or
we'll come and get you. Your choice.'
Get Security to seal off the
Power Station. But no one moves in.
Sir.
Sandra. let's see what he's up to.
'Switch it off.
And the other.
Simmonds!
It's too late for talk.
Simmonds. you're trapped.
'Really? I know precisely
what I'm doing.'
Open up.
Sandra. let's see that close up.
Switch to reserve power.
Stabilise that back-up power.
Trying to. sir.
Now. listen to me. Koenig.
This is my hostage.
Those men are just stunned.
Now don't make me kill anyone.
No one on Alpha will live for thirty
minutes without this unit in place.
Stabilise that power. Paul.
Now. I go on that ship
or Moonbase Alpha freezes over.
It's up to you.
What do you say now?
Commander.
countdown is T minus 28 minutes.
Do I continue counting?
Continue.
Simmonds. put back that unit.
Computer hasn't chosen yet.
Oh yes. I know my chances. Koenig!
Now this way. I go for sure.
It's my decision.
You can't make that decision.
I got to be Commissioner by doing
what's necessary. not what's right.
Now. you have 15 minutes
to persuade your alien friends...
or freeze.
Hold the countdown.
Get Captain Zantor here.
Captain Zantor to Main Mission.
If there's one man Alpha
could do without. it's Simmonds.
I say let him go.
Any decision we make
must involve Zantor.
We can't. We can't let
Simmonds jump the computer.
Moonbase systems are running down.
Commander. We must decide soon.
OK. So let Simmonds think he's going.
Commander.
We can take him on his way to
the ship. Especially if Zantor knows.
We can't play games
with that converter.
It's wrong. John.
but you've got to let him go.
Commissioner Simmonds insists
on returning to Earth with you.
Unless we agree. he'll destroy Alpha.
Is he capable
of carrying out this threat?
He is.
Then you must accept his terms.
I agree.
It's blackmail.
Let him go. Commander.
We'll be well rid of him.
Simmonds.
Koenig. Your decision?
We agree.
Give Simmonds restricted access from
the Power Station to the spaceship.
Guarantees. Koenig.
My word.
Not enough.
Commissioner.
you need our cooperation.
I will be your hostage.
I accept.
Captain. Here you are. Simmonds.
You'll need this.
Thank you. Captain.
I understand your position.
The Commissioner is...diseased.
It is a tragedy that he should
succeed through the use of force.
My thanks. Commander.
Professor.
You may now take
your travel position. Commissioner.
The rest is automatic.
You first.
Hello. Earth.
Hello. Earth.
This is Commissioner Simmonds.
returning home.
After seventy-five years.
'Earth Control. do you hear me?
'Come in. Earth. Hello Earth?
'Earth?
'Earth. can you read me?
Hello Earth?
Commander.
Yes. Paul?
'I'm getting a signal. sir.
from the Kaldorian spaceship.'
What kind of signal?
'From Commissioner Simmonds.
He thinks he's approaching Earth.
can you hear me?
'Earth?
'Hello. Earth?
'This is Commissioner Simmonds.
Can you hear me?'
Zantor knew. He must have known.
No. no.
Evidently Simmonds didn't give
him a chance to make a matrix.
Hello. Earth? Earth?
Earth. can you hear me?
What's the matter with everybody?
It hasn't worked.
It hasn't worked!
Koenig?
Koenig. can you hear me? Koenig!
'You've got to help me!
This hasn't worked!
'You've got to help me.
Send someone to get me. Koenig.
Koenig. help me!
There's nothing we can do.
Can you hear me? Koenig!
Koenig!
Zantor! ZANTOR! ZANTOR!
For God's sake! ZANTOR.
Help me. someone.
Come.
At last!
Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
Éothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few. So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn...
...where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock...
...but for a small culvert
at Its base...
...which is little more than a drain.
How? How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...
...thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look. There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising...
...from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time...
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal...
...and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar
protect you.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...
...and all that you hope for
comes true...
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...
...Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort
for you...
...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.
He will come to death...
...an Image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...
...In glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter...
...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...
...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell...
...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...
...until all the world is changed...
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here...
...only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...
...to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...
...the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country
will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer
Is falling.
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...
...the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen It.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find Its way back
Into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced
by Its power.
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...
...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving Its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...
...even unto to the ending
of the world.
The time of the Elves...
...Is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth
to Its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.
How many?
Some thousands. More come every day.
Who's covering the river to the north?
We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies? Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria...
...two were my kin...
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.
Dead?
How? When?
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me. Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish
To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please...
...let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master. Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me. Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol. That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No! No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No. Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No. No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go. Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on...
...he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you...
...two Halflings...
...and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...
...to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please. It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he? Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest...
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
All Isengard is emptied.
How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown...
...homes rebuilt.
Within these walls...
...we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people...
...down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...
...as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.
The old alliances are dead.
Gondor will answer.
Gondor?!
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn...
...we are alone.
Get the women and children
into the caves.
We need more time
to lay provisions...
There is no time. War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled...
...about the wars of Men and wizards...
...for a very long time.
But now, something
is about to happen...
...that has not happened...
...for an age.
Entmoot.
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech. Oak.
Chestnut. Ash.
Good. Good. Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide
if the Ents...
...will go to war.
Move back! Move to the caves!
Keep moving.
Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
Most have seen too many winters.
Or too few.
Look at them. They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord...
...will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West...
...behind the hills...
...Into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move! Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma...
...there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
Open the gate!
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
What's happening out there?
Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
Fire!
Fire!
Send them to me! Come on!
Good!
Swords! Swords!
Legolas! Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot...
...and we have agreed...
...you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Our friends are out there.
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.
War? Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit...
...it takes a long time...
...to say anything in Old Entish...
...and we never say anything...
...unless it is worth taking...
...a long time to say.
Seventeen! Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them! Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things
as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?!
You must help. Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread...
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate. Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
Hold them!
How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on. We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
Throw another one over here!
Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached. Retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.
Wait! Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
Turn around. Take us south.
South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes. Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then...
...you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad? We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please...
...let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice...
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
...Entish or the tongues of Men...
...for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight...
...with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely...
...that we go to our doom.
Last march...
...of the Ents.
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?
You want to know
why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here. Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.
And barricade the entrance!
So much death.
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.
At dawn...
...look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...
...shall sound in the Deep...
...one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath...
...now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit. A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin! Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...
...because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back
to the way It was...
...when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end,
It's only a passing thing...
...this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines,
It will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...
...that meant something.
Even If you were too small
to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories...
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.
They kept going...
...because they were holding
on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...
...somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.
I wonder if people will ever say,
Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. 
And they'll say,
Yes! That's one of my favorite stories. 
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:
Samwise the Brave. 
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
Samwise the Brave. 
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked. Tricksy. False.
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious...
...and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes. No! No!
It's too risky. It's too risky.
Where is he? Where has he gone?
Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes. She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it
once they're dead.


And here to pick
this years winning theme...
...is Ten Commandments star,
Charlton Heston.
Let my pigeons go!
He nailed one! We have our theme!
l submitted togetherness.
A simple theme.
But powerful, nonetheless.
Come on, overcoming adversity!
Lets go, overcoming adversity!
Show me women l gave the clap to!
And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is:
The episode of Whos the Boss?...
...where Tony sees Angela
naked in the shower.
Yes! Thats mine! Un-freaking-believable!
Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley
must be turning over in his grave.
Wait a minute. Hes not dead yet.
Michael Flatley.
lts great they picked your theme,
but isnt it a little esoteric?
Esoteric?
Could it mean sexy?
l think its a science term.
Fellas, esoteric means delicious.
Whos the Boss? is not a food.
BRlAN: Swing and a miss.
lt seems today that all you see
is violence in movies and sex on TV
But where are those good,
old-fashioned values
on which we used to rely?
Lucky theres a family guy
Lucky theres a man wholl
positively tell you
all the things that make us
laugh n cry
Hes a family guy
l have no friends,
and its all because of this stupid purse!
What did you do to my daughter?
l swear to God, if you touched her....
Honey, what happened?
lt was lunchtime and....
l love the color of your Prada bag.
Yeah, but yours has that great clasp.
Hey, Meg, you want to come to lunch?
You know what? Theres no room
in my car for your big, ugly purse.
Meg, let me tell you about popularity.
GlRL #1 : Mrs. Canner? Are you coming?
CANNER: Bye!
Daddy, if you really loved me,
youd buy me a Prada bag.
l cant say no to you, honey.
What are they, like, $10?
More like $1,100.
You wish l loved you that much!
Well never finish the float
in time for the parade.
Pick up the pace, guys!
Peter, your theme is a dud.
Yeah. lve never even seen
Whos the Boss?
Tuesdays in the 80s l was always
in bed by 8:00 and home by 1 1 :00.
But l cant do it without you guys,
because lll tell you whos the boss.
lts not Tony or Angela.
lts not even man-crazy Mona. lts all of us.
Youre the boss because you never
give up, like with the ladies.
Gemini.
Capricorn.
l know youre not a Virgo!
From down here, you Iook Iike a Pisces!
And Cleveland, youre the boss
because of your attention to detail.
Like when we play pool,
you take so long to line up your shots...
...l just want to crack you with a cue stick.
But l dont because that would be
a hate crime, and l love you.
And Joe, Ive had new neighbors before,
but none were haIf the man you are,
Since youre half a man already,
that splits them...
...into some kind of fraction
l cant even measure.
Hes right. lf we work together,
we can win this thing. Whos in?
Go, Spooner Street!
My dad always says,
Measure twice, cut once.
My daddy always said,
Cleveland Jr., quit jumping on the bed! 
We didnt measure!
BRlAN: Amazing. The whole
neighborhood is working together.
You know whats really amazing?
l havent brushed my teeth in three days,
and no one has said a thing.
lf l had a job, l could buy the bag myself.
l have squandered my munitions budget
on that insipid Rugrats video!
Perhaps l should seek employment.
Mother teaches piano.
l suppose l could as well.
All right, try it again, Richard.
And remember,
the wrong keys are electrified.
l dont want to play the piano!
lndeed.
Would you rather play the bassoon?
No experience? No, thanks.
Oh, nuts. Young lady.
Whats the little guys name?
What do you care?
l cant send an unwed teenage mother
out on the street without a job.
Stewie. My sons name is Stewie.
DlANE: Welcome to the 83rd annual
Quahog Harvest Festival Parade.
Are you as excited as l am, Tom?
Are you kidding, Diane? lve got wood...
...and clipped onto it
is a list of this years float entries.
Remember, the float that best captures
this years theme...
...wins Quahogs coveted Golden Clam.
And heres our first float.
DlANE: lt looks like some wires
got crossed on Clover Street.
Thats not AngeIa,
Thats Mona, AngeIas mom,
TOM: Wonderful use of tree bark
for the age spots though.
This ones got Tony bathing Jonathan,
Thats just pIain wrong,
Each float possesses its own
unique charm. But none of them--
Oh, baby! Look at that!
The float turned out great.
Our neighborhood hasnt been this united
since Quagmire got us free cable.
CLEVELAND: We are not bad people.
We just dont want to pay $12 a month
for Cinemax.
First place goes to Spooner Street.
RESlDENTS: We won! All right!
Come on now! This is damn foolish!
My theme, my trophy!
You said it yourself! lm the boss!
He said l, too, was the boss.
And its time Cleveland got his due.
BONNlE: Joe, my feet are starting to swell.
You two go home.
l can stay here as long as it takes.
Youd be amazed how little one eats
when your legs dont work.
Theres only one way to settle this.
Russian Roulette.
Three bullets, last guy standing
keeps the trophy. Me first.
No. Wait a minute, this is crazy.
You first.
Theres gotta be a way for you all
to enjoy the trophy.
Wait a minute! l got it! No, lost it.
There it is again!
LOlS: Perfect, Peter.
Now we can all enjoy it.
Heres to togetherness!
Car!
Meg, order up!
Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself.
l dont care if theyre
from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!
Try them. Youll like them.
Yes, well, l rather doubt that.
Yes! These are delectable.
Flappy, good news!
lve decided not to kill you!
What a precious little boy.
Thats my son.
Your son? But youre just a baby yourself.
Henry, give the little skank a nice tip.
Welcome to Flappys.
Why dont you sit next to my baby...
...whose deadbeat dad
doesnt pay child support.
Peter, what is it?
CLEVELAND: Whats going on out here?
Clear the way! lm a cop!
Oh, my God! l thought the safety was on.
lm so sorry.
Thats okay, son.
lts your right as an American citizen.
QUAGMlRE: Whats all the noise?
l was just jerked out of a sound sleep.
Perhaps someone could enlighten me as
to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?
Maybe it fell.
Yeah. Right into someones pocket.
You think one of us stole it?
l never said the word stole. Looks like
someone has a guilty conscience.
Guilty conscience!
lm the only guy on this block
who actually pays for his cable.
Pretty high and mighty for a man
who left our nations flag out in the rain...
...last Fourth of July.
Thats against the law, Officer!
Youre one to talk.
Out there every trash day
picking through my garbage.
Thats an invasion of my privacy.
Hes sorting your recycling
because he loves our Mother Earth.
lf you werent so busy
trolling for booty all the time...
...you could do it yourself,
like the law says you should.
PETER: lts on now!
JOE: Wait a second! What about Peter?
Hes the one
who wanted the trophy all along!
l couldnt have stolen it.
Last night l was stealing Joes ladder
so l could steal the trophy tonight.
What? lts a ladder. He cant use it.
lts like taking a watch off a dead guy.
Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe.
Real oddballs.
l dont trust them.
LOlS: l saw them taking coupons
out of our mailbox.
QUAGMlRE: l dont like the look of her!
l offer you a recipe.
Combine one small-town neighborhood
with a dash of missing trophy...
...and what youre left with is a gumbo
fit only for a madman.
A gumbo served almost exclusively in The--
PETER: Who the hell is that?
l bet he took it!
JOE: Where are you going, Serling?
Want some of this?
QUAGMlRE: Come back here!
lm off to work.
PETER: Okay, honey.
One of our neighbors took that trophy,
and lll find out who.
lm taking Stewie with me again.
Fine, sweetie.
This whole thing just makes me sick!
We played Pictionary with them!
Bastards!
Giddy-up, you stubby little mare!
To the pancake house!
Well, bye.
And to think
they used to be our best friends!
That was then and this is now!
And this is a chair. Thats a lamp.
You have boobies. lll find that trophy!
JOE: To be honest, Peter, we were all
a little surprised you invited us over.
We realized our friendship is a lot
more important than some stupid trophy.
Theres the tea. lll get it, Lois.
Two sugars, right, Bonnie?
Damn, its not here!
Not here either.
Nothing.
Oh, my God! We were robbed!
ls anything missing?
No. l dont think so.
LOlS: Wheres that picture of me
in my two-piece?
Should l call the cops?
lm guessing a cop
had something to do with this.
Or a pilot. Or a deli owner.
Okay, you dirtbags!
This means war!
Excuse us. Were having a small problem
with home security.
Do you have those round metal things
that you bury in the ground...
...and, when stepped on, they explode?
Land mines?
Land mines.
lt was land mines.
Quagmire.
Peter.
Cleveland.
Joe.
Bonnie.
Lois.
Cleveland.
Lois.
Bonnie.
Quagmire.
Peter.
Loretta.
Come on, Peter.
That ought to slow them down.
Being a single mother is hard.
The real challenge is having a baby
thats addicted to crack.
Right, Stewie?
Whats that? Yes. l love crack.
lm absolutely coo-coo for crack!
This is the first time hes eaten something
other than dog food in three weeks.
Heres your check. God bless.
WAlTRESS: Here, Honey.
STEWlE: Whats this? Blueberries?
Thats better than sex!
And could l get that waitress address?
ld like to help her baby.
What are they up to?
Cleveland and Quagmire
are holding their positions...
...but l havent seen Joe all day.
JOE: Freeze!
KEVlN: Dad?
JOE: Careful.
Theres a bear trap two feet to your right.
KEVlN: Thanks, Dad.
JOE: Look out for your mother!
BONNlE: Theres a sandwich
on the counter, honey.
Cleveland, these lobster traps
arent going to catch any intruders.
Yes, they will.
l baited them with these plump
and tasty Fenway franks.
Daddy, we got one!
Fat boy smelled a hot dog.
Couldnt help it. Went right in.
Hello.
Say, get the hell off....
Hello, lips, legs, breasts, and ass.
Yes. l was hoping l could ask you
about your neighbors, the Griffins.
A bunch of card-carrying Commies
if you ask me!
All right.
No! lts not all right!
CLEVELAND JR.: Fat boy!
The Griffins are not to be trusted.
Those people are nothing
but vile, cheating, lying scum.
And their carpet and drape scheme....
No! No, l wont!
Get that puree of loathsomeness
away from me!
But you love mashed turkey and peas.
lm sorry. What was that?
Sorry, l didnt quite catch that.
Did you just tell me what l love?
Write this down, you toad-faced frump.
l love pancakes!
Hi, little fella.
SANDY: ls Meg Griffin here?
LOlS: No, shes not.
Probably out scoring more rock.
Sandy Balfour, Child Services.
Were placing this baby in a foster home.
For Gods sake, feed me!
Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow?
What an awful home for a child!
How dare you! This is a wonderful home!
PETER: Quagmire, you rat bastard!
Come near my fence again,
and thatII be your head!
QUAGMlRE: Shut up!
Honey, would you like some pancakes?
Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me!
Stewie!
MEG: Next up is Meg Griffin,
sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new....
A woman from Child Services
came and took Stewie!
She said we fed him dog food!
Dog food?
ls that a real Prada bag?
How in the world did you make $1,100
as a waitress in one week?
lts easy...
...when youre the unwed teenage mother
of a crack-addicted baby.
Wait a minute.
Meg, when did you become a teenager?
Shes 16, Peter.
You knew about this?
Welcome to your new home.
Baby Stewie,
say hello to your new brothers and sisters.
HoIa, Stewie.
Ni hao, Stewie.
Stewie.
Good God!
lve been adopted by a Benetton ad!
l promise, itll never happen again.
l hope not, Mrs. Stevens.
Because next time we wont
just take him away, well kill him.
Lets see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens!
So this is where babies come from?
Yes, Chris.
This is where babies come from.
You told me l came out of your vagina!
Next!
Hi. Yeah, were the Griffins.
lm sorry. l cant find your paperwork.
Look harder! l want my baby back!
Please, let me handle this.
The names Griffin.
Were the ones who fed dog food
to our crack-addicted baby.
l never was any good
at dealing with the authorities.
Dont worry. l know how to handle this.
Are you aware you were going 50 in....
lm gonna have to ask you
to put your shirt down.
Crap.
l get the one straight cop in Rhode lsland.
STEWlE: Damn it! l want pancakes!
You people understand every language
except English!
Yo quiero pancakes!
Donnez-moi pancakes!
Click-click-bloody-click pancakes!
Poor little guy.
Pancakes must be street for crack.
Damn those parents of his.
Sarah, forgiveness.
Now, Stewie,
why dont you go play with the others?
GlRL: Stewie, come complete our rainbow!
lve got a better idea.
Lets go play
swallow the stuff under the sink.
You lied to them!
You told Child Services that we steal
lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes...
...and worship some guy named Stan.
Actually, l said Satan. Thats a typo.
We didnt know who she was!
lts not our fault!
No? Then whose fault is it?
BRlAN: lts all of yours!
You were all working together just fine,
but then you won that stupid trophy.
You put some shiny hunk of metal
before your own friendships.
Brians right.
We were so obsessed with that trophy,
we lost sight of what was really going on.
Now we have a real problem to deal with.
Thats right!
Somebody tipped off the cable company
about our free Cinemax.
Joe?
And we have to get Stewie back!
PETER: l remembered.
CLEVELAND: Were here to help.
And we must get our baby back.
Right on! Lets do it!
Rock their world!
GROUP: Yeah! Come on!
Lets go! We can do it!
See kids? One day the world
is going to be just like our home.
All races living together
in harmony and love.
Pancakes!
He must still be working the junk
out of his system.
He needs hugs!
Doorbell!
Were from the One World,
One People Book-of-the-Month Club.
ls there something missing in your life?
You know, l just bet there is.
Sarah, we have guests!
And one of them is a homosexual!
BONNlE: Theyre in place!
God, it gets me hot
when Joe Iies to strangers,
When l get him home,
l swear lm gonna grease up--
Thats fine, Debbie. Go, Chris.
Here we go, Dad!
Stewie, would you like
to learn how to wrap a turban?
Why dont you teach it to the Chinese girl?
Or perhaps she can learn
after her people invade your country.
Yee, would your people really do this?
Try and stop them.
And try and stop Pablos people
from using drug money to buy arms...
...from Lis countrymen,
who in turn sells them to Uras people...
...so they can ethnically cleanse
this nauseatingly diverse...
...grab bag of genetic party favors
you call a family.
So now you all understand, yes?
You all hate each other?
Hosanna! lts the lesser of two evils.
Hey, kids. lm Santa Claus.
Just practicing for Christmas.
But youre white.
Jack and Sarah told me Santa is lndian.
Dont be stupid! Santa is black!
Santa cant be black. We do not fear him.
CHlNESE GlRL: Cram it, Gandhi!
How can he be Asian?
Santa doesnt drive his sled 20 miles
under the speed limit with his blinker on!
Go back to your rice paddy, Mulan!
PETER: Come on, Stewie.
Were out of here.
Dance, puppets! Dance!
Lois, we got him. lts all over.
LOlS: CarefuI, Peter,
Joe and CIeveIand cant staII them,
Theyre heading your way!
Crap!
FOSTER DAD: Hold it right there!
Or what?
Dont shoot!
STEWlE: Now shoot!
So, were terribly sorry
we broke into your home.
But we just had to
get Stewie back somehow.
Thats a very long story.
But weve grown attached to little Stewie.
Plus, the laws on our side.
You people can kiss
the fattest part of my ass!
Well be back, Stewie.
FOSTER MOM: Wait!
ls that a real Prada bag?
ld like to propose a toast to our neighbors.
Sure they may be black, handicapped,
and a heartless sex hound...
...but if they moved out,
some smelly Hawaiians might move in.
Hear, hear!
Wheres Quagmire?
lf it wasnt for him,
we never would have found out...
...where Stewies foster family lived.
He said hed distract the social worker.
Glen, honey, l have a question for you.
What do you do for a living?
l have a question for you, too.
Why are you still here?
What the heck happened
to that trophy anyway?
l guess some mysteries
are better left unsolved.
Submitted for your approval.
A family pet with the uncontrollable urge
to bury shiny objects in the yard.
A shameful secret that nearly buried the
peace and civility of an entire neighbor....
Stewie seems a little feverish
after his ordeal.
And he keeps asking for pancakes.
Lets just let him rest.
Flappy, what have you done to me?
at this juncture of my life
to be quite boring.
...say Im one thing,
but actually you're another thing.
I think being true
to who you are is important.
I'm not saying you need to
be psychoanalytical
about the whole mess.
But don't be afraid.
Yeah, I...
but don't be afraid.
I had... I had lunch
with Jimmy Baldwin
the other day.
How is he?
He's a lovely man.
And he told me
the plot of his new book.
And he said to me,
"but I just want to make sure
it's not one of those
problem novels."
"your novel's about
a negro homosexual
who's in love with a Jew.
Well, wouldn't you call that
a problem?"
And he... and he looked at
and he laughed
because he knew I was right.
I'm saying, you know,
if you're gonna write
something like that,
at least be honest
why you're writing it.
Can't we just be honest?
Well, I don't think
you actually
need to be honest.
But don't come asking
some white man from the south
whether your book
about a black man
fucking some Jew,
when they're both
of the same sex,
is an issue!
Don't ask me that!
"Oh, no,
it's not an issue, Jimmy.
Everyone's gonna be-be-be
quite pleased
with that topic."
So how about you, Truman?
Do you admit it?
Well, Im not nearly
that controversial.
I'm not! I'm not! I am not.
I'm not nearly
that controversial.
Oh, come on.
Hi. It's Truman
for William Shawn, please.
Have you read the, uh,
the article
about the killings in Kansas
in the front section
of the New York times?
Well, I think that's what
I want to write about.
I... I want to go tonight.
I figured you'd missed it.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
I thought I was
heading to Kansas by myself.
God,
Im glad you agreed to come.
You're the only one I know
with the qualifications
to be both a research assistant
and a personal bodyguard.
Thank you.
Now Im nervous.
Yes?
Mr. Truman Capote
and miss Nelle Harper Lee?
Where would you like
these, sir?
You can put that right the
between the doors.
What all did you bring?
Just a few things.
Thank you greatly, sir.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
it's an honor
to have you with us, sir,
and I hope
you won't mind me saying,
but I thought
your last book was
even better than the first.
Thank you.
I mean, just when you think
they've gotten as good
as they can get.
Thank you very much.
You're pathetic.
You paid him to say that.
You paid him to say that.
How did you know?
"Just when you think
they've gotten as
good as they can get"?
I thought that
was a good line.
Do you think
that was too much?
Yeah, a little bit.
Your keys.
Thank you.
Sign here, please.
Alvin Dewey,
Kansas bureau
of investigation.
Hi. I'm looking
for Alvin Dewey.
Mr. Dewey.
Truman Capote,
from the New Yorker.
Bergdorf's.
Sorry?
The scarf.
Oh. Nice.
Thank you.
Mr. Dewey, I wonder
when we could
arrange an interview,
some time to talk.
Uh, about what?
Well, we're not looking
for any inside information.
You know, I don't care
one way or another
if you catch
whoever did this.
I'm writing an article
on how the clutter killings
are affecting the town.
You know,
how you all are bearing up.
I care.
Excuse me?
I care.
I care a great deal
if we catch whoever did this.
Oh, I see.
As do a lot of folks
around here.
Oh, of course.
Do you have press credentials?
What's a New Yorker?
Magazine.
Magazines don't give out...
you can come to
the news conference
with the rest of them.
Sears, roebuck.
The boy was 16?
He was 15.
Uh, Nancy was 16.
And it's her friend
that found them?
Uh, Laura Kinney.
Can you spell that?
Uh, I... I assume you're ok
with the Laura part.
But, uh, please, leave her be.
There's talk
of a bunch of Mexicans.
A whole bunch of Mexicans.
Hello, George.
It's good to see you again.
Uh, I do have an opinion
whether this was
the work of one man
or "a whole bunch,"
as you said,
but it doesn't
matter a whole lot
whether it was Mexicans
or Methodists or Eskimos.
We're gonna find
whoever did this.
Now, 4 good people
from our community are dead.
So let's remember that.
The west Kansas farm committee
is offering a $1,000 reward
for information
leading to an arrest.
Please print that.
And thank you all for coming.
He was... he was foxy
with that old man.
This make you miss Alabama?
Not even a little bit.
You lie.
I don't lie.
Good morning.
Can any of you tell me
where Id find Laura Kinney?
Is that her? With the boy?
Yeah, with Danny burke.
Danny burke?
Laura?
Thank you.
Truman.
I'm gonna find out
where that girl lives.
Can I do that alone?
All right?
I think I scared a friend
of yours this morning.
She came looking for you
when I was writing.
You hate my friends.
No, I wouldn't say "hate."
Just as long as they don't
knock on my door.
I saw the bodies today.
The clutters.
I... I looked
inside the coffins.
That's horrifying.
It comforts me.
Something so horrifying...
it's a relief.
Normal life falls away.
But then, I was never
much for normal life.
No.
Yeah, people here
won't talk to me.
They, uh, hmm,
they want someone like you,
like, uh, like Nelle.
Me, they hate.
I can't think of
a single quality
I share with Nelle.
Weli...
maybe manliness.
Good morning, Henry.
Good morning, sir.
Let's go.
Bye.
Hi, Danny. I'm Harper Lee.
Nancy was your best friend?
Yeah, she was my best friend.
How has Danny been?
Pretty shattered.
Nothing terrible has ever
happened to him before.
Danny was the last one
at the house that night.
That's why Mr. Dewey
keeps interviewing him.
They don't think that he had
anything to do with it.
It's just to see
if he remembers
anything unusual.
People in town do seem
to wonder if he was involved.
Yeah. That's been
really hard for Danny.
Oh, it's the hardest
when someone
has a notion about you
and it's impossible
to convince them otherwise.
Ever since I was a child,
folks have thought
they had me pegged
because of the way I...
the way I am.
You know, the way I talk.
And they're always wrong.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I wanna show you something.
Maybe this will give you,
um, a better picture
of what happened.
what is this?
It's your diary.
"Danny here tonight
and we watched TV.
"So nice just
having him sit with us.
"Left at 11:00.
P.s. He's the only one
I really love."
And that was that.
Did Laura say "shattered"?
Uh, "pretty shattered.
Nothing terrible has ever
happened to him before."
You know I have 94% recall
of all conversations?
I've tested myself.
Weli...
how did that happen?
Apparently
detective Foxy's wife,
uh, has read fiction.
That's great.
We're in.
We are in.
You came.
Thank you for having us.
Thank you.
Get yourselves in here.
Alvin, get your pants on.
They're here.
Hey, little Deweys.
Shake it with your wrist.
Use your whole arm.
More.
You think Im kidding around,
but Im serious.
Mama would've put in
half the bottle.
She had to buy it
by the crate.
Alvin's gonna hate this.
I have to stop.
Oh, I cannot believe
you're from New Orleans.
I miss it so much.
Well, I only lived there
for a short while,
was born and bred.
You know something?
Alvin pretends
he doesn't know who you are,
but the minute
you came to town,
he read your books.
No!
He had one of his men pick up
breakfast at tiffany's
'cause it's banned
in the library here.
And he said, "I feel
like you're spiting me."
"do you think I took
this job to spite you?"
I was writing the script
as they were filming,
all that time in Italy
and Id work like mad
all day long
and then dash down to the ba
around midnight
to hand in
the next day's scenes.
And Humphrey had just about
moved into the hotel bar...
Humphrey Bogart.
...where he and john...
john Huston.
they drank every night.
And I mean drank,
you know, like
famished water buffaloes.
Weli...
Id only just handed them
the final scene
when the bellhop told
me I had a phone call.
And it was my stepfather,
Joe Capote,
calling to say
that my mother had died.
I... I flew home to New York,
terribly distraught...
but when I got
to the apartment,
I could see
that Joe was in even
worse shape than I was.
He grabbed my hand
and he said to me,
"talk.
Talk about anything.
"You know?
"I mean,
any subject in the world.
"Don't worry whether
it'll interest me or not.
"Just talk...
so I won't break down."
He couldn't bear to be alone
with his thoughts.
It was too painful.
It's been a hard
couple of weeks for Alvin.
He and herb clutter
were good friends from church.
Oh, Marie.
Oh, come on, Alvin.
These are good people.
Why would they put a pillow
under the boy's head
just to shoot him?
Why would they tuck Nancy in?
So many of my friends
would love to meet you.
Oh, that'd be fine.
You don't have to worry,
'cause Im not going
to write about this
till everything's over.
Well, Im not worried.
I know what room
you're in at the hotel,
and I know where you live
in Brooklyn.
oh, god.
You're celebrating.
Uh, well,
remember Nelle's manuscript
she sent me in New York?
Yeah. Mockingbird.
Killing a mockingbird.
You said it was good.
And I was right.
She just heard Lippincott
wants to publish it.
Well, Jesus.
Jesus, well,
that's... that's terrific.
Tell her
congratulations from me.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Jealous.
Will you be home
by Christmas?
I... I wanna come home.
I wanna come home.
I do. I just...
thought if they catch
whoever did this,
who knows what?
I'll probably be here
till next Christmas.
I'm gonna let you go.
no, don't go. Um,
we'll go away
next spring to write.
Maybe Spain.
Yeah.
Ok, Im gonna let you go.
Jack, I promise.
We'll go away
this spring to write.
Maybe Spain.
All right.
My wife worked there, too.
What did she do in the house?
Cleaning.
Cooking a little bit.
Quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.
"Girdle up. No extra bulges.
"If you're dressed right,
when he gets home,
"the rest of the evening
should be smooth sailing.
Bon voyage, gals."
I can't believe
you got that whole page.
I only read it once.
I've tested my...
tested myself.
I have 94%...
percent recall.
Cut that out.
Cut that out.
cut that out.
Isn't that something, Alvin?
Oh, it's impressive.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. He's upset.
What's he upset about?
They know who did it.
2 men.
You know, they passed
through Kansas city last week
writing bad checks.
By the time
Alvin's boys got up there,
they were gone.
Skipped out.
Yeah. They... they don't know
where.
No idea.
One of them had a cellmate
who gave him up
for the $1,000 reward.
Do they know
the name of the cellmate?
No. No, I don't know.
Alvin knows.
I guess this isn't
the appropriate time
to go ask him.
He's beside himself.
Hello?
Alvin, get in here.
Dad, it's the telephone.
Not now, Alvin.
God damn it.
Get over here.
Alvin, not now.
You need to call
the chief of police
in Las Vegas.
Alvin, what'd you say?
He said you need to
call them immediately.
Truman Capote.
Dorothy Sanderson.
I figured you'd be
left alone this morning
by that hardworking
husband of yours,
so I have breakfast,
and I have news,
and I have literature.
My friend, Jack, mailed me
that book you wanted
and I inscribed it myself.
"To the maiden of the midwest,
the priestess of the plains,
the queen of the kitchen,
my first novel. Truman."
You're too much. Come on in.
Oh, thank you.
Go into the living room.
Have a seat.
Let me get that.
It's been ringing all morning.
Hello?
Truman, I meant in here.
That's the women's cell.
It's hardly ever used,
but they wanted them separate.
Let's sit in the living room.
They put you
in the women's cell.
Do you have any aspirin?
My legs.
Truman?
Please.
I'm sorry.
In the matter of
the state of Kansas.
Richard Eugene Hickock
and Perry Edward Smith,
this court has been informed
by counsel, Mr. Weeks,
that the defendants
wish to waive their right
to a preliminary hearing.
His mind is somewhere else.
Mr. Hickock,
is that your wish?
Yes, sir.
Why are they doing that?
Mr. Smith.
the waiver be effectuated.
"Effectuated"?
So noted.
Remove the prisoners.
Was it your choice
to waive the hearing?
Do you still need some?
Give me your hand.
I could kill you
if you got too close.
Now, would you
like some water,
or...
Mrs. Sanderson
lent you my book.
He said we'd curry
favor with the judge
if we waived our rights.
Who did?
The lawyer.
Your picture's undignified.
People recall
first impressions.
what's been your
first impression?
Hello.
Mr. Shawn.
Truman.
I'm writing a book.
It... it's too much
for a single article.
This town, the...
the killers most of all.
Uh, you will be stunned
by Perry Smith.
Why, what's happening?
Well, not much yet,
but I know.
I... I can sense him.
He... he's desperately lonely,
uh, frightened.
I have a question.
Are you ready?
Would it matter?
Uh, no.
How much more money
can you send me?
And... and how quickly
could you get Dick Avedon
out here to take
some pictures?
Who are you smiling at
right now?
I'm smilin' at you.
You know,
Dick's a very famous
fashion photographer.
World-famous.
Am I gonna be
in a fashion magazine?
So there's no worry
of having a bad picture.
Who were you closer to,
your mom or your dad?
Who were you closer to,
your mom or your dad?
Well, both.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Have you talked to them?
Yeah.
Who'd you talk to first?
Perry, honey,
you look terrific, baby.
That was good.
Can you show us the tattoo
on your chest then?
Yeah.
Where did Perry
get the art set?
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?
Yes, sir.
Defendants, rise.
Perry Edward Smith
and Richard Eugene Hickock,
you stand accused
of 4 counts of the crime
of murder in the first degree.
Have you reached
a unanimous verdict?
We have, your honor.
What is your verdict?
Guilty on all 4 counts.
Have you unanimously
reached a sentence?
We have, your honor.
What is the sentence?
Death.
I need to see him
before we go.
Perry.
They're going to transfer you
up to lansing today.
And you'll have to make sure
to put me
on the visitors list.
Otherwise I can't see you.
I'm going to help
find you a proper lawyer.
You need a serious lawyer
for an appeal.
Now they took Dick last night.
And I need you to get him
to do the same thing
and just put me
on the visitors list.
And I thought,
where does the family eat?
You know?
I mean, does he,
like, reach his hand
through the bars
and have dinner with everyone
around the table?
Nelle, kudos on, um...
kill the bird, is it?
That's... that's close.
Thank you.
That's marvelous.
Who's your publisher?
Lippincott.
Yes. It's a children's book
right?
Yes.
No, no. It's...
it's about children.
Yes.
Yes, Ive heard
a lot about it.
Good.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I didn't even know
she wrote.
He's sad and he's shy.
And he's terrified.
They shotgunned
the entire family
in the face.
And I thought, at first,
"mmm, Im gonna be
scared of these men.
I'm gonna run,
run, run right home."
Actually, the brother
in the family...
Kenyon is his name,
they had placed a pillow
under his head,
and then shot him
point-blank in the face.
Almost as if they were
putting him to sleep
and then shot him.
This is the start of
a great love affair.
Yeah. Truman
in love with Truman.
The book Im writing
will return him
to the realm of humanity.
It's the book I was
always meant to write.
Well, he hasn't actually
written a word of it yet,
but he says
it's the nonfiction book
of the decade,
so...
so...
what have you been doing?
And Ill tell you,
I was in Marilyns
apartment just last week,
talking about movies, art.
Finally I had to
break it to her that
of the 4 matisses
hanging on her wall,
2 were upside down.
Can I have another, please?
To answer your question,
Im following
breakfast at tiffany's
by blazing a different path.
By inventing an entirely
new kind of writing.
The nonfiction novel.
You have a subject?
Yes.
On the night of November 14,
2 men broke into
a quiet farmhouse in Kansas
and murdered an entire family.
Now, why did they do that?
2 worlds exist
in this country.
The quiet, conservative life,
and the life of those 2 men.
The underbelly.
The criminally violent.
And those worlds converged
that bloody night.
Now, I spent the past 3 months
interviewing
everyone in Kansas
touched by that violence.
Now I spent hours
talking to the killers
and Ill spend more.
'Cause researching this work
has changed my life.
You know,
it's altered my point of view
about almost everything.
Yeah.
And I think those who read it
will be similarly affected.
So you find them
a new lawyer.
Well, they're facing
execution in 6 weeks.
You know, they need
someone to argue
whether or not that's right.
And Id also like to
see them alive.
Weli...
yeah.
Yeah, I need to
hear their stories.
Well, just be careful
what you do to
get what you want.
Im finding them a lawyer.
Truman, you're
finding yourself a lawyer.
No, Im finding them
a lawyer.
There's a difference.
The Warden will see you now.
Well, we do all right
by our boys.
Showers once a week.
Feed them good.
We'll be feeding Perry Smith
in the infirmary soon
if he don't eat.
Try and get the food in
through his arm.
I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?
Well,
he hasn't eaten in a month.
It ain't his right
to kill himself.
It's the right of the people.
The people of this state.
And that's who I work for,
the people.
No one told me.
Yeah, he won't eat.
When can I see him?
Well, let me see.
How about you coming 3:00,
Thursday afternoon?
No.
that's no good.
I need to see them now.
Then... then whenever I want,
for as long as I want.
Well, that's just not
how we do things
around here, Mr. Capote.
Yeah, I understand
what a burden
unlimited visitation might be
on this institution
and on the people
who pay for it.
And I want to be clear
that I don't expect
the citizens
of Leavenworth county
to have to
shoulder that burden.
This is to be dispensed
as you see fit.
You know, I didn't know
where to count your boy
at first,
him being half-Indian.
But I did him a favor.
I counted him as a white man.
Uh-huh. You're a kind
and generous man.
Spread your feet.
This way.
Hey, hey.
Yeah, hello.
Hey,
thanks a lot for your help
with the lawyer.
Oh, that's fine.
Wow, you must be
really desperate for a story
to come all the way out here.
You want to go
see Perry, go ahead.
Thank you.
You want my advice,
though, Mr. Capote,
he's just trying to prove
the insanity defense.
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's Truman.
It's your friend.
It's ok.
This is before she had us.
Before she started drinking.
Who took care of you
as a child?
Orphanage.
Me and Linda.
And that's your sister?
You know,
we're not so different
as you might think.
Yeah, I was abandoned
repeatedly as a child.
My mama would drag me along
to some new town,
so she could take up
with another man she'd met.
Night after night,
she'd lock me
in the hotel room alone.
Mama would turn the latch
and tell the staff
not to let me out
no matter what.
And I was terrified.
And Id scream my head off...
until finally Id collapse
on the carpet
next to the door
and Id fall asleep.
Then after years of this,
she just left me
with relatives in Alabama.
Who raised you up?
And that's where I met Nelle.
And she lived...
she lived next door.
Your mother was Indian?
Cherokee.
So drinking was not
a good thing for her.
No tolerance for it.
We're on, uh, suicide watch.
That's why they leave
the lights on at night.
I hope
we're past that now.
I do.
Be careful of Ricardo.
I think he wants you
all to himself.
All right.
But he's
naturally mendacious.
Not to be trusted.
If he had $100,
he'd steal a stick
of chewing gum.
Perry,
I want to take
your notebooks with me.
I want to read them.
If I leave here
without understanding you,
the world will see you
as a monster
always.
I don't want that.
'Cause he trusts me.
I mean,
that's why he gave it to me.
And he-he's given me
absolutely everything.
And he wants so badly
to be taken seriously
to be held in some esteem.
Do you?
Do I what?
Do you hold him
in esteem, Truman?
Well,
he's a gold mine.
And he's told me
his entire life.
his dead mother.
Uh, he had a brother
and a sister kill themselves.
Awful.
Did you tell him
your mama did the same thing?
See, I can't tell him
everything.
We've been
talking our heads off
for the past month.
And sometimes when I...
when I think how good
my book can be,
I can hardly breathe.
Anyway, th-this is...
this is what I wanted
to read to you.
"if called upon
to make a speech..."
"if called upon
to make a speech"?
I mean, this is exactly
what Im talking about.
A speech, just in case
he's ever recognized
for an achievement.
"I can't remember
what I was going to say
for the life of me.
"I don't think ever
before have so many people
"been so directly responsible
"for my being
so very, very glad.
"It's a wonderful moment
and a rare one.
Thank you!"
There's... there's an
exclamation point at
the end of that "thank you"
in case you didn't catch it.
Where'd you go?
I guess it
stopped being funny.
I... I never said it was.
But, wait,
listen to this.
I was 14.
One day I said to him,
mom's dead.
I could see it.
A week later we got the news.
She finally drunk
herself...
...found her shivering...
she hit me so many times
with that flashlight,
she broke it.
I dreamed about
that big yellow bird.
Clawed that nun's eyes,
bright like the sun.
Lifted me to the sky.
Sometimes you see a thing
how it really is.
Well, you're nothing
if not hardworking.
Hey, you look good.
Healthy again.
You know, Ive decided
on a title for my book.
I think you'll like it.
It's very masculine.
In cold blood.
Isn't that good?
And that refers to the crime
or the fact that
you're still talking
to the criminals?
Oh, the former,
among other things.
I see.
I wanted to ask
if you'd let me look
at your investigation notes.
That lawyer you helped find
for your friends
got them a hearing at
the Kansas supreme court...
yeah, I heard this morning.
...on the issue
of inadequate counsel.
Alvin,
I mean,
do you not want me
to look at your notes?
You are permitted to say no.
I'll tell you what.
If those boys get off,
Im coming to Brooklyn
to hunt you down.
I have to be in court
at 9:00,
but you call Roy Church
and he'll show you
what you want to see.
Thank you.
It's as much for me
as for anyone.
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you so soon.
We're gonna be able
to use your book
for our case.
You... you'll write
we never got to raise
an insanity plea.
You wrote how terrible
the lawyers was.
I... I haven't written
a word yet.
What have you been doing?
Research. Talking to you.
All right.
I... I had hoped...
wh-what are you calling it?
The book?
I have no idea.
Perry,
if Im going to
write about you,
if Im going to determine
how to write about you,
we need to talk about,
you know, why you're here.
you know, the murders,
at the clutter house.
Do you worry
what Ill think?
Dick says you know
Elizabeth Taylor.
I know a lot of people.
Perry, I have invitations
to be in morocco, Greece,
and I prefer to be here
with you.
Jack, be patient with me.
this one piece.
Well, how long
is that gonna take?
Why don't you just
try leaving him alone
for a while?
Come to Spain.
You can always
visit him later.
I don't know.
Well, Im off.
I'm just... Ive got
my own writing to do.
Well, do it in Brooklyn.
Wait for me.
There's too many
people around. I've...
Ill leave the address
on the kitchen table.
Well,
think about what I said,
and join me when you can.
I will.
I will.
Bye.
Truman.
We never intended
on killing that family.
Capote,
will you get that straight
in your book, please?
No premeditation.
What are you doing?
I have to fly back east.
When?
An hour.
I miss you already.
Write me every 5 minutes.
Hey, you know,
we never did intend
on killing that family.
Capote?
Capote?
Truman,
Ive not been
able to tear myself
away from your book.
It's that good.
It's... it's not good,
it's astonishing.
This first half
is astonishing.
Oh, thank you.
When will you be done,
do you think?
Yes, I... Im already
well into the third part.
till I convince Perry
to describe the night
of the killings to me.
I was... I was planning
to visit this fall, see?
Then I think you need
to talk to him now.
And we all need to see
how this ends
for the final part.
I... I... I can't finish the book
till I know what happens.
If Perry and Dick
are executed, it's one thing.
And if not, weli...
Truman,
you've got your ending.
I really don't know.
The Kansas court
denied their appeal.
It came over the wire
on Friday.
I mean, you need to
talk to Perry now.
He'll be dead by September.
I mean, Im sorry.
I know how much you've come
to care about him.
Right. Yes, right.
So I want to set up
a reading for you
in the fall, in New York,
and, uh, well,
we'll build some interest,
and we'll publish
in the fall.
Thank god.
There's nothing in the house.
Why aren't you working?
Well, I knew
you couldn't be counted on
to stock the kitchen.
What are we going to feed
our famous guest?
Oh, Jesus,
I completely forgot.
Plus, I, uh,
finished my novel yesterday.
When was the last time
you wrote to him?
I don't know.
It's a letter for Truman
I was asked to deliver.
It's from Perry.
Let's have it.
"Dear friend Truman,
where are you?
"Read this item
in a medical dictionary.
'Death by hanging
is caused by asphyxia,
'by fracture of
the cervical vertebrae,
'by laceration
of the trachea.'
"Not too comforting,
as we lost our appeal.
"Missing you.
"Alone and desirous
of your presence.
Your amigo, Perry."
Mr. Shawn told me
about the court
decision yesterday.
I was wondering why you were
in such a good mood.
a terrible thing to say.
I... I write him all the time
Ive just...
Ive been so focused on-
on the book lately.
So Jack thinks
Im using Perry,
but he also thinks
I fell in love with him
when I was in Kansas.
Now, how both of those things
can be true is beyond me.
Thank you.
Well, did you?
Did you fall in love
with him?
I don't know
how to answer that.
Truman.
Perry and I grew up
in the same house,
and one day he stood up
and went out the back door
while I went out the front.
Are you kidding me?
No.
Listen, you be nice to Jack.
Sometimes I think
he's what I like
about you best.
I'll see you
at the reading in New York.
Adios.
What was he in jail for?
Well, they said it was
for not paying his taxes,
but really,
for being an outsider.
Refusing to go along.
Lowell, you're being moved.
You're going to
final holding.
No.
Come on, Lowell.
Open the door.
Put your arms
behind your back.
Ok, last chance.
Well, get up.
Turn around.
Put your arms
behind your back.
Now Dick and me,
we're next in line.
I'm so sorry Ive been away.
It was a long time.
I know.
How's the book coming along?
Oh, very slowly.
Will you show it to me?
I've hardly written anything.
Good evening, New Yorkers,
and thank you for coming
to the first public reading,
the first offering
of any kind,
of Truman Capote's new work,
in cold blood.
Hello.
My name is Truman Capote.
For this...
for this evening's program,
Im going to read, uh,
some passages
from the first 3 parts
of my new book.
"The village of Holcomb
"stands on
the high wheat plains
of western Kansas,
"a lonesome area
that other Kansans
call 'out there.'
"Until one morning
in mid-November, 1959,
"few Americans,
in fact, few Kansans,
had ever heard of Holcomb.
"Like the waters
of the Arkansas river,
"like the motorists
on the highway,
"exceptional happenings
never stopped there.
"Perry Smith's voice
was both gentle and prim.
"A voice that, though soft,
"manufactured
each sound exactly,
"ejected it like a smoke ring
issuing from
a parson's mouth.
"The 4 coffins,
which quite filled
the small,
flower-crowded parlor
"were to be sealed
at the funeral services,
"very understandably,
"for the effect
was disquieting.
"Nancy wore her dress
of cherry-red velvet,
"her brother
a bright plaid shirt.
"The parents
were more sedately attired,
"Mr. Clutter
in navy-blue flannel,
his wife in navy-blue crepe.
"And it was this especially
that lent the scene
an awful aura,
"the head of each
was completely encased
in cotton.
"A swollen cocoon
"twice the size of
an ordinary blown-up balloon.
"And the cotton,
"because it had been sprayed
with a glossy substance,
"twinkled like
Christmas tree snow.
"One Tuesday at dawn,
a carload of strangers,
"ignorant
of the local disaster,
"were startled
by what they saw
as they crossed the prairies
"and passed through Holcomb.
"Windows ablaze.
"Almost every window
in almost every house,
the brightly-lit rooms,
fully-clothed people,
"even entire families,
"who had sat
the whole night wide awake
watchful, listening.
"Of what
were they frightened?
It might happen again."
Thank you.
And I slipped
and I ripped a hole
from the bottom
of my scrotum...
All the way
up to the top
of the crack of my ass.
And I sat there.
And I didn't know it.
All I felt was a...
I... I didn't know it.
All I felt was a cool breeze
you know, between my...
Sorry. If I may, uh...
yes.
Your portrait of those men
was terrifying.
Terrifying.
Thank you.
Stop that man!
Come back here!
Have any of you
met my father?
He hasn't spanked me
in years.
George didn't come backstage.
He had... he had a...
something that his wife
had to rush him off to.
But he made a point of...
yeah, well, Im still wal...
Im still waiting for a call.
It was beautiful.
And everybody came.
Hmm. Tennessee...
everybody came.
Tennessee loved it.
Of course he loved it.
Should we do more?
No, we... we just sit and wait
while people talk about it
and we let them do the work.
I mean,
this... this book is going
to change everything.
It's gonna change
how people see your writing.
I think it's going to Chan
how people write.
Are you gonna be finished
by October?
I think so.
You know, they're scheduled
for next month.
To hang.
Yeah.
We're gonna commit
as many issues
as it takes to publish.
Whatever it takes.
Well, Im going to Kansas
tomorrow, and...
and Ill get Perry to talk.
What's he got to lose?
Sorry, but...
hey, this may
sound strange to you,
but Im going to miss him.
You'll be able to finish now.
Need to check your
papers, sir.
This is what we've been
waiting for.
A stay of execution
to make a federal appeal.
All thanks to you.
Thank you!
They're not gonna
corner me now.
Not unless the U.S.
Government says so.
for me for 10 years.
They can't corner me now.
Hey, Perry, sit down
for a minute.
I... I need you to talk to me.
We've got all the time
in the world to talk.
I've been
thinking about Ricardo.
You really need
to stop sending him
those trashy books.
I won't even
mention the pornography.
Now, I realize that
Dick probably can't
grasp the literature
that you gave me.
Uh, the books you
send him only...
they only exacerbate
the problem.
They only heighten
or intensify it.
Maybe we can get him
started on a program.
Perry,
I know what
"exacerbate" means.
Ok, well, just thinking...
there... there's not
a word or a sentence
or a concept that you
can illuminate for me.
There is one singular reas
I keep coming here.
Truman.
November 14, 1959.
3 years ago. 3 years.
And that's... that's all
I want to hear from you.
Now I asked you not to. Ever.
This is absurd.
Do you know
what absurd means?
I'm ready.
I have a plane to catch.
I found your sister
in Tacoma.
Maybe she'll talk to me
about something useful.
Please don't go out there.
Hey, this is my work, Perry.
I'm working.
And when you want to tell
what I need to hear,
you let me know.
June's dead.
Frank shot himself.
Now Perry did what he did.
I used to love him.
He was my little doll.
He scares me now.
When was the last time
you saw him?
10 years ago.
10 years.
Could I borrow
one of these pictures?
Take the whole thing.
I don't want them anymore.
Don't be taken in
by my brother.
He's got this sensitive side
he'll show.
You believe he's gentle
and so easily hurt,
but he'd just as soon
kill you as shake your hand.
I believe that.
Hello, handsome.
What's the name of your book?
What's the name of your book?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
"Truman Capote
read last night
before a packed audience
"from his nonfiction
book in cold blood.
"The true-crime novel
tells of killers
Richard Hickock
"and Perry Smith,
who brutally murdered
a Kansas family 3 years ago."
Wait, who sent that to you?
That's not
your goddamn business.
It is my business,
because it's not true.
The organizers of
the reading needed a title.
They picked one,
a sensational one, I admit,
to attract a crowd.
They picked it?
Yes.
It's not your title.
Perry,
I haven't chosen one yet.
How could I choose a title
when we still haven't
talked about that night?
How could I?
I couldn't possibly.
You pretend to be my friend.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.
And I couldn't pretend
to be your friend
'cause the truth is,
I can't help wanting to be.
You don't have to
tell me anything...
if you don't want to.
I have something
from your sister.
She misses you.
Look at my belly.
There must be
something wrong with us,
to do what we did.
We heard there was
$10,000 in that house.
Once we tied up everybody
and searched all over,
I knew the guy
that told us about it was...
was wrong. There was...
there was no money.
Dick wouldn't believe it
so he went tearing
through the house,
banging on the walls
looking for a safe.
When he was done, he...
said he was gonna go up
to Nancy's room
and have his way with her.
I wouldn't allow it.
And I told him that.
So I sat with her.
Dick came up and got me.
We turned off the lights
and went down to the basement
where Mr. Clutter
and the boy was.
He kept saying,
"no witnesses," but I...
I figured
if I waited him out, he'd...
he'd give up
and we'd leave them
tied up there.
And we'd drive all night.
They'd never find us.
We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists
to a pipe over his head.
And he... he looked hurt,
so I cut him down.
I... I put a box out there
so he'd be more comfortable.
He asked how his wife
and daughter was
and I... I said they were fine,
and they were getting ready
for sleep, and it wouldn't
be long tili...
till morning
when they'd find him.
He was just looking at me.
Looking into my eyes.
Like he expected me
to kill him.
Like he expected me to be
the kind of person
who would kill him.
I was thinking,
"this... this nice man
is scared of me."
I was so ashamed.
I mean, I thought
he was a... a very nice...
gentle man.
And I thought so right up
till I slit his throat.
I didn't know what I did
till I heard the sound.
Added up,
how much money did
you get from the clutters
Between $40 and $50.
I mean, the truth is,
Im desperate
to be done with it.
I've spent 4 years of
my life on this book.
They got a stay of executive
yesterday.
Another, yes.
Supreme court.
It's harrowing.
Me, all I want to do is
to write the ending
and there's no end in sight.
No, thank you.
"Dear friend Truman,
"haven't heard from you
in such a long while.
"Please help find new lawyer.
"If not,
Dick will have to write
"the supreme court brief
himself.
"Our last appeal.
"What a pair of
wretched creatures.
"Please help.
Your amigo? Perry."
Just put it with the others.
You know, at least for Nelle
you should...
you should try and pretend
you're having
a good time tonight.
I thought
Id find you here.
Oh, Nelle.
Nelle.
Thank you.
I'll have another,
please.
How are you?
Terrible.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean,
it's torture the way...
what they're doing to me.
And now
it's the supreme court.
And can you believe it?
If they win this appeal,
I wili...
have a complete
nervous breakdown.
I may never recover,
and Ill just pray
that it turns my way.
It must be difficult.
Oh, it's torture.
They're torturing me.
I see.
And how'd you like the movie,
Truman?
Yeah...
I frankly don't see
what all the fuss is about.
Hello.
Mr. Truman Capote?
Yeah.
I have a call
from Mr. Perry Smith
in the Kansas
correctional system.
Will you accept charges?
Yes.
Mr. Smith,
you're on the line.
Hello.
Hello?
Hello, Perry.
They let me make
a couple of phone calls
before I go down to holding.
Y-y-you heard
the supreme court
rejected the appeal?
No, I... I didn't.
I hadn't heard that.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. They let me make
2 phone calls.
We got a date set
for the warehouse,
Dick and me.
2 weeks and finito.
April 14.
Will you visit me?
Truman?
It is utterly inappropriate
for me to talk to him.
Yes?
I'm sorry,
he won't be able to make it.
Hello?
Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle.
I just got this telegram.
Has he seen it?
He won't read it.
Would you put him on,
please?
Nelle, he won't talk.
Mr. Shawn,
if you have to hold him down
and put the phone on his ear,
I need to speak to him.
All right.
it's Nelle.
Truman.
"Miss Nelle Harper Lee
and Truman Capote.
"Sorry that Truman
was unable to make it
here to the prison
"for a brief word
prior to necktie party.
"Whatever his reason
for not showin' up,
"I want him to know
that I cannot
condemn him for it.
"Not much time left,
"but want you both to know
that Ive been
sincerely grateful
"for your friendship
through the years
"and everything else.
"I'm not very good
at these things.
"I have become
extremely affectionate
toward you both.
"But, harness time.
Adios, amigos.
Your friend, Perry."
Well, I didn't expect
to see you again.
You can visit
for a few minutes.
Yeah.
No.
5 minutes.
Well, well.
He returns.
I don't know
what you must think of me.
Well,
you haven't been foremost
on my mind lately,
as you can probably imagine.
You got the letter?
Yes, I did.
It's true.
I understand why you
didn't want to come.
I wouldn't be here either
if I didn't have to.
You got that right.
You know Ricardo
donated his eyes
to science?
Next week,
some blind man will be seeing
what Dick used to see.
Yeah, you could be
walking in Denver
or somewhere, Truman,
and suddenly these eyes
will be staring at you.
That would be something,
wouldn't it?
It would be. It would be.
You'll be watching?
I don't know, Ill be...
do you want me to?
I'd like to have
a friend there.
Ok. Then I will.
It's all right.
I did everything I could.
It's ok.
I truly did.
I know.
It's time.
Mr. Capote.
Goodbye.
You're not rid of us yet.
We'll see you
in a few minutes.
I wish I had...
Mr. Capote.
Mr. Capote.
Goodbye.
Nice to see you.
Perry Edward Smith.
For the crime of murder
in the first degree,
by order of the cour
t of Finney county
and the supreme court
of the sovereign state
of Kansas,
you are sentenced
to hang until you die.
"I will fear no evil:
For thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."
You can say something
if you want.
Is there anybody
from the family here?
No, Perry.
Well, tell them...
I can't remember
what I was gonna
say for the life of me.
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day
our daily bread.
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not
into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
It was a terrible experience
and I will never get over it.

But she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances...
for beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away....
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late...
for she had seen that
there was no love in his heart .
And as punishment, she transformed him
into a hideous beast...
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there .
Ashamed of
his monstrous form...
the beast concealed himself
inside his castle...
with a magic mirror as
his only window to the outside world.
The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose...
which would bloom until his 21st year.
If he could learn to love another...
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell...
then the spell would be broken.
If not,he would be doomed...
to remain a beastfor all time.
As the years passed...
he fell into despair and lost all hope...
for who could ever learn to love a beast?
Little town lt's a quiet village
Every day, like the one before
Little town
full of little people Waking up to say
Bonjour, Bonjour, Bonjour ...
There goes the baker
with his tray like always
The same old
bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
to this poor provincial town
Good morning, Belle.
Morning, monsieur.
Where you off to?
The bookshop. I just finished
the most wonderful story...
about a beanstalk and an ogre and ...
That's nice.
Marie, the baguettes!
Hurry up!
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell
Never part of any crowd
'Ca use her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl
that Belle
Bonjour
Good day
How is your family?
Bonjour
Good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive
There must be more than this provincial life
Ah, Belle!
Good morning.I've come to return
the book I borrowed.
Finished already?
Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new ?
Not since yesterday .
That's all right.
I'll borrow this one.
That one?. But you've read it twice!
Well, it's my favourite!
Far-off places daring sword fights,
magic spells, a prince in disguise.
If you like it all that much,
it's yours .
But, sir!
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far- off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle
Oh ... lsn't this amazing
lt's my favourite part
Because
you'll see here's
where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him.
Till chapter three
Hey-hey !
Hey-hey-hey !
Now it's no wonder that
her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!
You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!
I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you, ha ha ...
and no girl, for that matter.
It's true, Lefou.
And I've got my sights set on that one.
The inventor's daughter?
She's the one! The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
But she ...
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but-- Oau ...
That makes her the best!
And don't I deserve the best?
Well, of course! I mean, you do! But ...
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous
And I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle
Look, there he goes
lsn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston.
Oh, he's so cute. He steal my heart
I'm hardly breathing. He 's such a tall,
dark, strong and handsome brute
Bonjour. - Good day.
You call this bacon
What lovely grapes
Some cheese
Ten yards
Excuse me
I'll get the knife
Please let me through
This bread, it 's stale
Those fish, they smell
Madame's mistaken
There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife
Look, there she goes, a girl
who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
She doesn't quite fit in
Because she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle
Bonjour
Bonjour
Hello, Belle.
Bonjour, Gaston.
Gaston, may I have my book, please?
How can you read this? There's no pictures!
Well, some people use their imagination.
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books...
and paid attention to more
important things.
Like me.
The whole town's talking about it.
It's not right for a woman to read.
Soon she starts getting ideas and thinking.
Gaston, you are positively primeval.
Why, thank you, Belle.
What do you say you and me take a walk over
to the tavern and take a look at my trophies?
Maybe some other time.
What's wrong with her?
She's crazy.
He's gorgeous!
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father. Goodbye.
Ha ha ... That crazy old loon!
He needs all the help he can get.
Don't talk about my father that way !
Yeah! Don't talk about her father that way !
My father is not crazy. He's a genius!
Papa? Coughing ...
How on earth did that happen?
Are you all right, Papa?
I-I'm a-- I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk of junk.
You always say that.
I mean it this time!
I'll never get this
Bone headed contraption to work!
Yes, you will, and you'll win
first prize at the fair tomorrow .
And become a world-famous inventor.
You really believe that?
I always have .
Well, what are we waitin' for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.
Hand me that-- the-- the--
the dog-legged clincher there .
So, did you have a good time in town today ?
I got a new book.
Papa, do you think I'm odd?
My daughter? Odd?
Where would you get an idea like that?
Oh, I don't know. It's just that
I'm not sure I fit in here .
There's no one I can really talk to.
What about that Gaston?
H-He's a handsome fella.
He's handsome,
all right,and rude and conceited and...
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.
Well, don't you worry 'cause this invention's
gonna be the start of a new life for us.
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.
It works !
It does?
It does!
You did it! You really did it!
Hitch up Philippe, girl. I'm off to the fair!
Boom ...
Goodbye, Papa. Good luck!
Goodbye, Belle. Take care while I'm gone.
We should be there by now.
Maybe we missed a turn.
I guess I should've taken... Wait a minute.
No. Let's go this way .
Come on, Philippe, it's a short cut.
We'll be there in no time.
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We better turn around. Whoa. Whoa, boy...
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.
Oh! Oh! Look out! No!
Whoa! Whoa, boy !
Back up, back up, back up! Good boy! Good boy .
That's good, that's-- Back up!
Steady, steady, now .
Steady.
Steady. No, Philippe!
Philippe?
Where is he?
Rrr Rrr...
Rrr Rrr...
Help!
Is... Is someone there ? Help!
Hello?
Poor fellow must have
lost his way in the woods.
Keep quiet. Maybe he'll go away .
Is someone there ?
Not a word, Lumiere .
Not one word !
I-I don't mean to intrude, but I've lost my horse...
and-- and I need a place to stay for the night.
Oh, Cogs worth,
Have a heart .
Shh! - O-O-Ow! Ow! Ow!
Of course, monsieur,
you are welcome here .
Who said that?
Over here .
Where ?
Hello.
Incredible!
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere .
Splendid! Just peachy! Aaaa...
How is this accomplished?
Put me down at once! Stop that!
Hee-hee-hee. Stop that, I say!
Aoo .... Sir,
close that at once! Do you mind?
I-I beg your pardon? It's...
It's just that I've never seen a clock that ...
Oh, you are soaked to the bone, monsieur.
Oh, you are soaked to the bone, monsieur.
Come.Warm yourself by the fire.
Thank you.
No, no, no!
You know what the master will do if he finds him here .
I demand that you stop right there !
Oh, no, no! Not the master's chair!
I'm not seeing this!
I'm not seeing this!
Well, hello there, boy .
Oh, what service!
All right!This has gone far enough. I'm in charge here....
Ah, would you like a spot of tea, sir?
It'll warm you up in no time.
No! No tea. No tea!
His mustache tickles, Mama!
Oh! Hello!
Brramm ...
Uh-oh.
Rrrr...  There's a stranger here.
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.
He was cold and wet, so...
Master, I'd like to take this moment to say...
I was against this from the start .
It was all his fault. I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no--
Who are you? What are you doing here ?
I-I-I was lost in the woods and ...
You are not welcome here !
I-I-I'm sorry.
What are you staring at?
N-Nothing.
So, you've come to stare at the beast, have you?
Please, I meant no harm!
I-I just needed a place to stay .
I'll give you a place to stay !
No, no, please! No! No!
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?
Yep, this is her lucky day .
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.
First I better go in there
and propose to the girl.
And you, Lefou, now,
when Belle and I come out that door...
Oh, I know! I know !
I-I strike up the band!
Not yet!
Sorry.
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.
You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.
This is the day--
This is the day your dreams come true.
What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty ! Here. Picture this.
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire...
and my little wife massaging my feet...
while the little ones
play on the floor with the dogs.
We'll have six or seven.
Dogs?
No, Belle.Strapping boys like me. Imagine that.
Do you know who that little wife will be?
Let me think.
You, Belle.
Gaston, I'm ....I'm speechless.
I really don't know what to say .
Say you'll marry me.
I'm very sorry, Gaston, but ...
but I just don't deserve you!
So, how'd it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife .
Make no mistake about that.
Touchy !
Is he gone?  Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.
Me,
the wife of that boorish, brainless...
Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it
Madame Gaston
his little wife
No, sir, not me
I guarantee it, I want much more than
this provincial life
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
I want it more than I can tell
And for once it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more than they've got planned
Philippe! What are you doing here? Where's...
Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.
What is this place?
Philippe, please, steady.
Steady.
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?
Just had to invite him to stay, didn't we?
Serve him tea,
sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch!
I was trying to be hospitable.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Are you here?
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.
Really, Mama. I saw her.
Not another word. Into the tub.
A girl! I saw a girl in the castle!
See, I told ya!
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy eared, slack..jawed...
Did you see that?
It's a girl!
I know it's a girl.
Don't you see? She's the one!
The girl we have been waiting for!
She has come to break the spell!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Hello?
Is someone here?
Wait! I'm looking for my father.
I'm sure there was someone.
I-Is anyone here?
Hello
Belle?
H-H-How did you find me?
Oh, your hands are like ice.
We have to get you out of there.
Belle, I want you to leave this place.
Who's done this to you?
No time to explain.
You must go. Now!
I won't leave you.
What are you doing here?
Run, Belle!
Who's there? Who are you?
The master of this castle.
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?
Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!
But he could die. Please, I'll do anything.
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.
Oh, there must be some way I can
Take me instead.
You?
You would take his place?
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!
If I did, would you let him go?
Yes, but you must promise
to stay here forever.
Come into the light.
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!
You have my word.
Done!
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.
Belle!
No! Please spare my daughter.
Please!
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.
Let me out. Please let me out!
Uh, since the girl is going to be
with us for quite some time...
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.
Then again, maybe not.
You didn't even let me say goodbye.
I'll never see him again.
I didn't get to say goodbye.
I'll show you to your room.
My room? But I thought ....
You wanna... You wanna stay in the tower?
No.
Then follow me.
Say something to her.
I, uh, hope you like it here .
The castle is your home now,so you can go
anywhere you like except the west wing.
What's in the west ...
It's forbidden!
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!
Who does she think she is?
That girl has tangled with the wrong man.
No one says no to Gaston!
Darn right!
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!
Why, it's more than I can bear.
More beer?
What for? Nothing helps.
I'm disgraced.
Who, you? Never!
Gaston,
you've got to pull yourself together.
Gosh, it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Looking so Down in the dumps
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're everyone's favourite guy
Everyone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard to see why
No one's Slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as
in credibly thick as Gaston
For there's no man in town
Half as manly Perfect A pure paragon
You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team
they prefer to be on
No one's been like Gaston
a kingpin like Gaston
No one's got a swell cleft
in his chin like Gaston
As a specimen
yes, I'm intimidating
My, what a guy that Gaston
Give 5 hurrahs
Give 12 hip -hips
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips
No one Fights like Gaston
Do uses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston
For there's no one as burly and brawny
As you see I've got biceps to spare
Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
That's right!
And every last in chofme's covered with hair
No one hits like Gaston
Matches wits like Gaston
nobody spits like Gaston
I'm especially good at expectorating. Ptooey!
Ten points for Gaston
When I was a lad late four dozen eggs
Every morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size Of a barge
No one Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston
Then goes tromping a round
wearing boots like Gaston
I use antlers in all Of my decorating
My, what a guy Gaston
Help! Someone help me!
Maurice?
Please! Please, I need your help.
He's got her-- He's got her locked in the dungeon!
Who?
Belle. We must go. Not...Not a minute to lose.
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.
Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous beast!
Is it a big beast?
Huge!
With a long, ugly snout?
Hideously ugly!
And sharp, cruel fangs?
Yes, yes! Will you help me?
All right, old man. We'll help you out.
You will? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Crazy old Maurice.
He's always good for a laugh.
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?
Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.
Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking
A dangerous pastime
I know
But that wacky old cootis Belle's father
And his sanity's only so -so
Now, the wheels in my head have been turning
Since I looked at that loony old man
See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle
And right now I'm evolving a plan
If I--  - Yes?
Then we--  - No, would she?
Guess!
Now I get it!
Let's go!
Let's go!
No one Plots like Gaston
Takes cheap shots like Gaston
Plans to persecute harmless
Crack pots like Gaston
So his marriage
we so on will be celebrating
My, what a guy Gaston
Will no one help me?
Who is it?
Mrs Potts, dear.
I thought you might like a spot of tea.
But you're-- You're a--
Oh! Careful.
This is impossible!
I know it is, but here we are .
I told you she was pretty, Mama,didn't I?
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now. Don't spill.
Thank you.
Wanna see me do a trick?
Oops, sorry.
That was a very brave thing you did, my dear.
We all think so.
But I've lost my father...
my dreams, everything.
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.You'll see.
Oh, listen to me...jabberin' on while
there's a supper to get on the table.
Bye!
Well, now, what shall we dress you in for dinner?
Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers .
Oh, how embarrassing!
Ahem. Ah, here we are!
You'll look ravishing in this one!
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.
Ah, but you must!
Ahem, ahem... Dinner is served.
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.
Why isn't she here yet?
Oh, try to be patient, sir.
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day .
Master, have you thought that perhaps...
this girl could be the one to break the spell?
Of course I have! I'm not a fool.
Good! So, you fall in love with her...
she falls in love with you,
and poof! The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere. These things take time.
But the rose has already begun to wilt.
Oh, it's no use.
She's so beautiful and I'm-- Well, look at me!
Oh, you must help her to see past all that.
I don't know how .
Well, you can start by
making yourself more presentable.
Straighten up. Try to act like a gentleman.
Ah, yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.
Come, come. Show me the smile.
But don't frighten the poor girl.
Impress her with your rapier wit.
But be gentle.
Shower her with compliments.
But be sincere .
And above all,
you must control your temper!
Here she is!
Good evening.
Well, where is she?
Who? Oh, ha ha ha! The girl, yes. The girl.
Well, actually, she's in the process of- -
Circumstances being what they are--
Uh, she's not coming.
Oh, dear. Your Grace!
Your Eminence! Let's not be hasty !
I thought I told you to come down to dinner!
I'm not hungry.
You'll come out or I'll-- I'll break down the door!
Master, I could be wrong,but that may not be
the best way to win the girl's affections.
Please attempt to be a gentleman.
But she is being so difficult.
Gently, gently.
Will you come down to dinner?
No!
Suave, gently.
It would give me great pleasure...
if you would join me for dinner.
And we say please.
Please.
No, thank you.
You can't stay in there forever!
Yes, I can.
Fine! Then go ahead and starve !
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!
Oh, dear. That didn't go very well at all, did it?
Lumiere, stand watch at the door...
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.
You can count on me, mon capitaine.
Well, we might as well
go downstairs and start cleaning up.
I ask nicely, but she re fuses.
Wh-Wh-What-- What does she want me to do, beg?
Show me the girl.
But the master's really not so bad
once you get to know him.
Why don't you give him a chance ?
I don't want to get to know him.
I don't want to have
anything to do with him.
I'm just fooling myself.
She'll never see me as anything...
but a monster.
It's hopeless.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
I've been burnt by you before.
Zut alors!
She has emerged!
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.
But I'm not sleepy .
Yes, you are .
No, I'm not.
I work and I slave all day long, and for what?
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!
Oh, stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.
Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn!
After all, he did say please.
But if the master doesn't learn to control
that temper,he'll never break the--
Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle.
I am Cogsworth,head of the household.
This is Lumiere.
En chante, cherie.
If there's-- stop that--
anything we-- please--
can do...to make your stay more comfortable--
I am a little hungry.
You are ? Hear that? She's hungry!
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.
Remember what the master said.
Oh, pishtosh! I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then--
Cogsworth,
I am surprised at you!
She's not a prisoner. She's our guest!
We must make her feel welcome here .
Right this way, mademoiselle.
Well, keep it down.If the master finds out
about this,it will be our necks .
Of course, of course.
But what is dinner without a little music?
Mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax.
Let us pull up a chair
as the dining room proudly presents...
your dinner.
Be our guest
Be our guest Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
and we provide the rest
Soup dujour Hot hors d'oeuvres

We tell jokes, I do tricks

Und it's all inperfect taste
That you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be our guest. If you're stressed
lt's fine dining we suggest
Be our guest, be our guest
Be our guest
Life is so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait up on
Get off!
Ah, those good old days when we were useful
Suddenly those good old days are gone
Ten years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise A chance to use our skills
Most days we just lay a round the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and upsy-daisy
lt's a guest, it 's a guest
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

As you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up. Be our guest
Be our guest...Be our guest
Please be our....Guest
Bravo! That was wonderful!
Thank you.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
Oh, I couldn't possibly go to bed now .
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.
Enchanted!
Who said anything about the castle being enchanted?
It was you, wasn't it?
I figured it out for myself.
I'd like to look around,
if that's all right.
Oh, would you like a tour?
Wait a second. Wait a second.
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.
We can't let her go poking around in
certain places, if you know what I mean.
Perhaps you'd like to take me.
I'm sure you know everything
there is to know about the castle.
Oh, well! Actually, I--
Yes, I do.
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away
to reveal the minimalist rococo design.
Note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings.
This is yet another example
of the late neoclassic Baroque period.
And, as I always say ,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.
Where was I?
As you were!
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the--
Uh, mademoiselle?
What's up there?
Where? There? Oh, nothing.
Absolutely nothing of interest
at all in the west wing.
Dusty, dull, very boring.
Ah, so that's the west wing!
Nice going.
I wonder what he's hiding up there .
Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
That's, uh, uh-- Mademoiselle would,
uh, like to, uh, uh, see something else?
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to--
Maybe later.
Uh, the-- the gardens...
or, or the-- the library perhaps?
You have a library?
Yes! Oh, indeed.
With books.
Scads of books!
Mountains of books!
Forests of books!
Cascades!
Cloudbursts!
Swamps of books!
More books than you'll ever
be able to read in a lifetime.
Books on every subject ever studied...
by every author who ever set pen to paper.
by every author who ever set pen to paper.
Oh, oh.
Why did you come here?
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I warned you never to come here!
I didn't mean any harm.
Do you realize
what you could have done?
Please! Stop!
Get out!
No!
Get out!
Where are you going?
Promise or no promise...
I can't stay here another minute.
No, wait, please!
Please wait!
No!
Here, now. Don't do that.
Just hold still.
That hurts!
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.
By the way, thank you
for saving my life .
You're welcome.
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night...
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.
I'm listening.
It's like this.
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.
But she needs a little persuasion.
Turned him down flat!
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.
He was in here tonight raving
about a beast in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is,
Belle would do anything...
to keep him from being locked up.
Yeah, even marry him.
So you want me to throw her father
into the asylum...
unless she agrees to marry you.
Oh, that is despicable!
I love it!
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone!
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes!
I'll find that castle
and somehow, I--
I'll get her out of there.
Belle! Maurice!
Oh, well. Guess it's not gonna work after all.
They have to come back sometime.
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.
Lefou, don't move from that spot...
until Belle and her father come home.
I've never felt this way about anyone.
I want to do something for her,
but what?
Well, there's the usual things.
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.
Ah, no, no, it has to be
something very special.
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute!
Belle?
There's something I want to show you.
But first,
you have to close your eyes.
It's a surprise.
Can I open them?
No, no. N-Not yet.
Wait here.
Now can I open them?
All right. Now!
I can't believe it!
I've never seen so many books
in all my life .
You-- You like it?
It's wonderful!
Then it's yours.
Oh, thank you so much.
Would you look at that!
I knew it would work.
What? What works?
It's very encouraging.
Isn't this exciting?
I didn't see anything.
Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.
There's something sweet
and almost kind
But he was mean
And he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why
I didn't see it there before
She glanced this way
I thought l saw
And when we touched
she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me
that waybefore
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought
That this could be .... true.....
That he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him
That I simply didn't see
Well, who'd have thought
Well, bless my soul
Well, who'd have known
Well, who indeed
And who'd have guessed
they'd come together on their own
It's so peculiar, wait and see
We'll wait a see
A few days more
There maybe something there
that wasn't there before
You know, perhaps there is something
there that wasn't there before
There maybe something there
that wasn't there before
What's there, Mama?
I'll tell you when you're older.
Right, then, you all know
why we're here .
We have exactly 1 2 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds...
to create the most magical,spontaneous...
romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.
Right. Need I remind you that as
the last petal falls from this rose...
the spell will never be broken!
Very well.
You all know your assignments.
Half of you to the west wing,
half of you to the east wing...
the rest of you,come with me.
Lighten up, Cogsworth,
and let nature take its course.
It's obvious there's a spark between them.
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames,
you know-- a little.
Besides, they must fall in love tonight
If we ever expect to be human again.
Yes, think what that means.
I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each charm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again
Which should cause
Several husbands alarm
I'll hop down off this shelf
and tout suite be myself
I can't wait to be human again
Be human again
Only human again
We'll be knick-knacks
and what-nots no more
When we're human again
Good and human again
Oh, cherie,
we'll be only top drawer
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
And I won't be so huge
Why I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savoir faire
I'll wear gowns
I'll have hair
It's my birth
to be human again
When we're human again
Only human again
When the world once more
starts making sense
I'll unwind for a change
Really that would be strange
Can I help it I fl'm t- t- tense
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks and relax
When I'm human again
So sweep fast
round the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel I can tell
Someone might break the spell
Any day now
Shine up the brass on the door
Alert the dustbin and broom
I fit all goes as planned
Our time maybe at hand
Any day now
Open the shutters
and let in some air
Put these here
And put those over there
Sweep up the years
Of sadness and tears
And throw them away
We'll be human again
Only human again
When the girl finally
sets us all free
Cheeks a-bloomin' again
We're assumin' again
We'll assume our long lost
joie de vivre
We'll be playin' again
Holiday in 'again
And we 're prayin' its' A.S.A.P.
We will push
We will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally be human again
There never was a story of more love
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo
Could you read it again?
Here, why don't you read it to me?
Uh, all right.
You mean, you never learned?
I learned-- a little.
It's just been so long.
Well, here, I'll help you.
Let's start here.
Here.
Okay. ''Twoh--''
'Two.'
''Two.'' I knew that.
'Two households...'
We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around
with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing
those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again
We'll be gliding again
Stepping, striding
As fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn
And we 're all of us human
Tonight is the night.
I'm not sure I can do this.
You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.
Bold! Daring!
There will be music,
romantic candlelight...
provided by myself.
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love .
Yes, I con--
I, I-- No, I can't.
Look, You care for the girl, don't you?
More than anything.
Well, then you must tell her.
Voila! Oh, you look so-- so--
Not quite the word
I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more off the top.
Your lady awaits.
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bitters weet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.
Good night, love .
Belle?
Are you happy here with me?
Yes.
If only I could see my father again
just for a moment.
I miss him so much.
There is a way .
This mirror
will show you anything...
anything you wish to see.
I'd like to see my father, please.
Papa! Oh, no!
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.
Then you-you must go to him.
What did you say ?
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.
You mean, I'm free?
Yes.
Oh, thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way .
Take it with you
so you'll always have a way...
to look back and remember me.
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.
Well, Your Highness, I must say...
everything is going just swimmingly.
I knew you had it in your heart.
I let her go.
Yes, yes, splen--
You what?
How could you do that?
I had to.
Yes, but, but, but-- but why ?
Because I love her.
He did what?
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
She's going away ?
But he was so close.
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love .
That's it then.
That should break the spell!
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.
Now it's too late.
They're back.
Belle!
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I missed you so much!
But the beast--
Did you-- How did you escape?
I didn't escape, Papa.
He-- He let me go.
That horrible beast?
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.
Oh, a stowaway.
Why, hello there, little fella.
Y-- Didn't think I'd see you again.
Belle, why'd you go away ?
Don't you like us any more ?
Oh, Chip. Of course I do.
May I help you?
I've come to collect your father.
My father?
Don't worry, mademoiselle.
We'll take good care of him.
My father's not crazy!
He was raving like a lunatic!
We all heard him, didn't we?
Yes!
No, I won't let you!
Belle?
Maurice, tell us again, old man.
Just how big was the beast?
He was-- I mean,
he was-- he was, uh, enormous!
I'd-- I'd say at least eight,
uh, no, more like ten feet!
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that!
It's true, I tell you!
Get him out of here!
Let go of me!
No! You can't do this!
Poor Belle.
Oh, it's a shame about your father.
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if- -
If what?
If you marry me.
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.
Never!
Have it your way !
Belle? Let go of me!
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it!
Show me the beast.
Is it dangerous?
Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone.
Please, I-I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.
He's my friend.
If I didn't know better...
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are !
She's as crazy as the old man!
The beast will make off
with your children.
He'll come after them in the night.
No!
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall!
I say we kill the beast!
We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children
to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village
if we let him wander free
So it 's time
to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me
Through the mist, through the woods
through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare
but it 's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the draw bridge of a castle
And there's something
truly terrible inside
lt's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we 're not coming home
Till he's dead
Good and dead
Kill the beast
No, I won't let you do this.
If you're not with us,
you're against us.
Bring the old man!
Get your hands off me!
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature !
Let us out!
We'll rid the village of this beast!
Who's with me?
Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage
to the sticking place
We 're counting on Gaston
to lead the way
Through a mist, to a wood
where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking
That you don't see every day
lt's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest
Till he's good and deceased
Sally forth, tally-h o
Grab your sword and your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!
I have to warn the beast.
This is all my fault.
0Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?
Now, now .
We'll think of something.
We don 't like what we don 't understand
In fact, it scares us
And this monster
is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village
And our lives
We'll kill the beast
I knew it. I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.
Could it be?
Is it she?
Sacrebleu! Invaders !
Encroachers !
And they have the mirror!
Warn the master. If it's a fight
they want, we'll be ready for them.
Who's with me?
Take whatever booty you can find.
But remember,
the beast is mine!
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching in to battle
Unafraid although the danger
just in creased
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come 50 strong
And 50 Frenchmen can 't be wrong
Let 's kill the beast
Pardon me, Master.
Leave me in peace.
But, sir,
the castle is under attack!
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
This isn't working.
Oh, Lumiere, we must do something!
Wait! I know !
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
What shall we do, Master?
It doesn't matter now .
Just let them come.
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
Now !
Yes!
Here we go!
What the devil?
Belle, look out!
You guys gotta try this thing.
Up here, you scurvy scum.
Now !
And stay out!
Get up!
Get up!
What's the matter, beast?
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?
No!
Belle!
No, Gaston, don't!
Let's go, Philippe.
Come on out and fight!
We re you in love with her,
beast?
Did you honestly think
she'd want you...
when she had someone like me?
It's over, beast!
Belle is mine!
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, don't hurt me.
I'll do anything. Anything!
Get out!
Beast!
Belle.
Belle?
You came back.
You-- You came back.
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them--
Oh, this is all my fault.
If only I'd gotten here sooner.
Maybe it's better- -
it's better this way .
Don't talk like that.
You'll be all right.
We're together now. Everything's
going to be fine, you'll see.
At least...
I got to see you one last time.
No! No!
Please! Please!
Please don't leave me.
I love you.
Belle, it's me!
It is you!
Lumiere !
Cogsworth!
Mrs Potts!
Look at us!
Oh, my goodness!
It is a miracle!
Ah, I'amour.
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.
I beg your pardon, old friend, uh,
but I believe I told you.
No, you didn't. I told you!
You most certainly did not,
you pompous, paraffiln-headed peabrain!
En garde,
you-you overgrown pocket watch!
Take that!
Stop shoving.
Are they gonna live
happily ever after, Mama?
Of course, my dear.
Of course.
Do I still have to sleep
in the cupboard ?

...not the least of which, his historical
fight with Senator McCarthy.
He is the host of our enormously
popular show "Person to Person"...
...and tonight he is here
with his son, Casey...
...wife, Janet, and all of you
who he's worked with...
...inspired, lectured, and taught.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the Radio-Television News Directors'
Association and Foundation welcomes...
...Mr. Edward R. Murrow.
This might just do nobody any good.
At the end of this discourse
a few people may accuse this reporter...
...of fouling
his own comfortable nest...
...and your organization may be
accused of having given hospitality...
...to heretical
and even dangerous ideas.
But the elaborate structure
of networks...
...advertising agencies, and sponsors
will not be shaken or altered.
It is my desire, if not my duty,
to try to talk to you journeymen...
...with some candor about what
is happening to radio andtelevision.
And if what I say is responsible...
...I alone am responsible
for the saying ofit.
Our history will be
what we make of it.
And if there are any historians
about 50 or 100 years from now...
...and there should be preserved...
...the kinescopes of one week
of all three networks...
...they will there find recorded
in black and white, and in color...
...evidence of decadence,
escapism...
...and insulation from the realities
of the world in which we live.
We are currently wealthy, fat,
comfortable, and complacent.
We have a built-in allergy to
unpleasant or disturbing information.
Our mass media reflect this.
But unless we get up off
our fat surpluses...
...and recognize
that television in the main...
...is being used to distract, delude,
amuse, and insulate us...
...then television
and those who finance it...
...those who look at it
and those who work at it...
...may see atotally
different picture too late.
Millie! Just the person
I wanted to see! Come here!
This goes at the top
of the Roy Campanella piece.
Yes! Give me a half an hour.
I may need it
a little quicker than that!
Can I get some coffee first?
Come on! Get me some coffee!
Morning, Johnny!
I have some new notes that go
with the Tito footage for Fred.
Fred's gonna be in
in an hour.
I already put them on his desk.
Can you just make sure that...
...he doesn't look at the film
until he reads the notes?
Yes.
Thank you.
Hey, Joe! Shirley!
What's going on in here?
What do you mean?
Two attractive people
alone in the copy room!
Don't tell Paley, he'll fire me.
He'll fire both of us, Shirley.
Rules are made to be broken!
You can afford to say that.
Let me see this.
It's simply a loyalty oath.
To CBS? - And to America.
You promise to be a loyal American?
I know. All of the reporters
have signed this.
Who are you promising this to?
Fred signed it.
Murrow signed it.
Murrow signed it?
Yeah.
Are you now
or have you ever been...
I thought it was a joke,
but there's a lot of pressure.
...on the Attorney General's list
of subversive groups?
I don't know.
Let's think about it.
What is it really saying? Is it a civil
liberties issue or censorship?
Am I simply stating to CBS
that I'm not a Communist?
Murrow signed this?
And Fred and Stanton.
Maybe you should talk toMurrow.
Maybe I should sign it.
If you don't sign this,
are you and I a target?
If I don'tsign it,
they'll fire me.
Finally we can tell everyone
the truth.
If I could express it
in what's in my heart now...
...I'd do it in the terms
of the poet who once said...
..."Ah, 'tis but a dainty flower
I bring to you. "
'Yes, 'tis but a violet... "
... glistening with dew. 
"But still in its heart
there lie beauties concealed. "
So in our heart... 
... our love for you... 
... lies unrevealed. 
I used to...
...pride myself on the idea
that I was a bit... tough...
...especially over the past
19-19 months, when we've been...
...kicked around,
and bullwhipped, and damned.
...I could be... touched very deeply.
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough, Leo.
It's short.
Howlong is the piece?
It's 4 minutes,
but we can cut it down.
It cant stand alone, but it might be
a nice companion piece.
Let's go through this one more time.
Palmer!
Yep, got a call from the office
of Senator Morse this morning...
...interested in setting up
a debate possibly with Senator Kerr...
...over the comments
Bentsen made on last night's show.
Secretary of Agriculture? Good idea!
Can they do it by this week?
No, it would have to be 2 weeks
at the earliest...
...depending on Morse's schedule.
But still it's a great idea.
Let's follow up on that.
Hoover speaks on Benjamin Franklin. 
We're having better luck
with Mr. Benjamin Frankin...
...than with Mr. Hoover.
It may progress better
as a "Person to Person".
"At home with Ben Frankin.
His electricity awards. "
We've got the footage,
we need to contact him.
See if you can contact him and get the
shot. He wants to do the story. Joe!
Member Delbert Clark?
No longer with us.
New York Times? - Yeah.
Our friend at the Times.
This was yesterday morning,
they're saying it's...
How old was he?
53. Sudden illness.
Home of a friend.
No, it's not a nobit piece.
Natalie send some flowers
over there from us.
Couple things.
Case before the Supreme Court...
...involving the constitutionality of a
section of the Internal Security Act...
...provides for the deportation
of any alien...
...if he becomes a Communist
after entering this country.
Can you take this?
All right. McCarthy interrupting
his wedding trip...
...to take charge of the investigation
of Communist infiltration...
Natalie, send some flowers.
Poor Mrs. McCarthy!
It's national security!
A real ladies' man!
Well, they're in love.
We have no show for Tuesday, fellows.
So get out there and make some news.
Rob a bank. Mug an old lady.
Do something.
You look at the Secretary Stevens
footage? - We will.
Watch it all the way to the end,
it's worth it.
Thank you, John.
There's notmuch there.
I can't tie it to the Eisenhower
in the back of the train piece.
You ever spend any time in Detroit,
Fred? - Not recently.
There's a story here
in the Detroit News, Dexter, Michigan.
A kid named Milo Radulovich.
Italian? - Irish. Air Force
kicked him out because his dad...
...reads ome Serbian newspaper.
Was he a Communist? - I don't know.
Who brought the charges?
Air Force.
Charges were in a sealed envelope,
nobody saw them.
Not even at the hearing? - He was
declared guilty without a trial...
...and told if he wanted
to keep his job...
...he had to denounce his father
and his sister. Thank you, Natalie.
His sister?
He told them to take a hike.
Let's send Joe and Charlie down there,
see if he's any good on camera.
Is he being brought
before the Committee?
No.
Then it's not McCarthy.
Milo Radulovich.
What happens to your children...
...your 5-year-old and your 5-month-old
in terms of you?
If I am being judged
on my relatives...
...are my children going
to be asked to denounce me?
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...
...why their father
is a security risk?
If the thing is let stand
as it, the first recommendation...
...was sent out by the board,
I see a chain reaction that...
...has no end to anybody,
for anybody.
Well, that's new.
You can't call this
a neutral piece.
The other side's been represented
rather well for the last 2 years.
The Air Force
hasn't gone on the record.
So you want to forego the standards
you've stuck to for 15 years...
...both sides, no commentary.
We all editorialize. - I'm just
making sure we identify what...
We're giving them
the information up front...
...and we're asking them
to comment on it.
Frank, hold on.
I've searched my conscience.
I can't for the life of me
find any justification for this.
I simply cannot accept
that there are, on every story...
...two equal and logical sides
to an argument.
Call it editorializing, if you'd like.
It is editorializing.
They'll have equal time
to defend themselves.
Do you understand the position
you're putting us in?
We are all in this together,
if the Senate wants to investigate...
Do me a favor...
...avoid any big speeches about how
we're all in a big boat together!
Please, don't insult me.
I have to go back to Mr. Paley
and Alcoa, who sponsors your show...
...and also have
some military contracts...
...and I have to tell them that
they're going to be in a tough bind...
...because of a beef you had
with Joe McCarthy.
We're not going at McCarthy.
You're starting the goddamn fire.
Excuse me. Mr. Friendly,
there's a Colonel Anderson to see you?
Colonel? - He's in your office.
There are two of them.
Maybe they liked the transcript,
and want to compliment us on it.
Excuse me.
Go after Joe Kennedy.
We'll pay for it.
I've got a great story about Hoover.
You know how many shows
you're going to have to do...
...to make up for this? - And Judy
and her daughter Liza next week.
No, no.
You're interviewing Rin Tin Tin!
I'll talk to Mr. Paley.
Alcoa wont pay for the ads.
And we probably wont either.
But nobody'll stop you.
How much are the ads?
I'll split it with Fred.
He just won't have Christmas presents
for his kids this year.
He's a Jew. - Don't tell him that,
he loves Christmas.
To be clear, you did speak
with the lawyers? - Yes, we did.
And we read the transcript. We've not
been allowed to see the footage.
Mack is on a plane from Dexter
right now with the last interviews.
We'll be going
right down to the wire.
Your show airs tomorrow. How can we
possibly approve and check...
...your story in the limited amount
of time you have given us?
With all due respect, you have been
invited to participate in this piece...
...not to approve it.
We are going with the story
that says that the U.S. Air Force...
...tried Milo Radulovich
without any evidence...
...and found him guilty
of being a security risk...
...without his Constitutional rights...
You have not seen the evidence...
...and are claiming
he's not a security risk.
Wouldn't you guess that those who have
seen the contents of that envelope...
...might have a better idea of what
makes someone a danger to his country?
Who? Who? - Or do you think
it should just be you that decides?
Who are the people?
Are they elected? Are they appointed?
Do they have an axe to grind?
Is it you, sir?
Or you, Colonel Jenkns? Do you know
the contents of that sealed envelope?
We have been a friend and ally of both
Mr. Murrow and CBS News for many years.
The story you are going
to run tomorrow is without merit.
So before you take any steps
that cannot be undone...
...I strongly urge you
to reconsider your stand.
These are very dangerous waters
you are attempting to navigate.
We have had no hearing at all.
We have had noday in court.
In all the 32 years that I have been
a practicing attorney in Detroit...
...I have never witnessed such a farce
and travesty upon justice...
...as this thing has developed.
Now this whole theory...
Eddie, just take the first reel.
Tell John I left
5 seconds extra leader.
5 seconds! I got it! Palmer,
where's Joe? Have you seen Joe?
He's on his way
to the control room.
We're gonna have to do
the voice-over live.
Natalie, I need a booth
with a live mic.
Booth is there, it's already set.
We didn't have time
to sync the voice-over out.
That's not what I asked for.
It's missing the voice-over
on the last piece.
There's a commercial in the booth.
What shall I do?
2 minutes to air! - There's not
supposed to be a commercial!
Get himout of the booth!
2- and-a-half minutes
on the end piece.
Keep it down, please.
It's a little loud.
2 minutes to air, fellas.
He's gonna add a joke.
Charlie, loan me your lighter.
Make sure you know that I swap
with those two pieces of parents.
As long as he talks fast because...
He will talk fast.
We got the film.
Will it be ready?
You bet.
Funny thing, Freddy!
Every time you light a cigarette
for me, I know you're lying.
It occurs t ome
we might not get away with this one.
Alcoa, the aluminum company
of America...
10 seconds.
You fellas, ready? Okay.
Ready on camera 1.
Pan, camera 1.
Good evening.
A few weeks ago there occurred a few
obscure notices in the newspapers...
...about Milo Radulovich...
...a lieutenant
in the Air Force Reserves.
And, also, something about Air Force
regulation 35-62...
...which states that a man
may be regarded as a security risk...
...if he has close and continuing
association with Communists...
...or people believed
to have Communist sympathies.
Lieutenant Radulovich was asked
to resign in August. He declined.
A board was called
and heard his case.
At the end it was recommended that
he be severed from the Air Force...
...although it was also stated
that there was no question whatever...
...as to the Lieutenant's loyalty.
We propose to examine,
in so far as we can...
...the case of Lieutenant Radulovich.
Our reporter, Joe Wershba,
cameraman, Charlie Mack.
This is the town of Dexter, Michigan.
Population 1500.
This statue is at the end
of Ann Arbor Street erected by...
What did the General
tell you yesterday?
A Colonel. There were two of them.
That makes a General.
They weren't too pleased.
You're gonna get audited this year.
Not me, you. I told them
I didn't want to do the story.
You always were yellow.
Better than red.
In 10 seconds.
This is the sister,
Margaret Radulovich Fishman.
She neither defends nor explains
her political activities.
I feel that my activities,
be what they may...
...or my political beliefs
are my own private affair.
Are my children going to be asked
to denounce me?
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...
...why their father
is a security risk?
I see, absolutely,
that this is a chain reaction.
If the thing is let stand as it,
the first recommendation...
...was sent out by the board
I see a chain reaction...
...that has no end to anybody,
for anybody.
Perhaps you will permit me
to read a few sentences...
...because I would like to say
rather precisely what I mean.
We have told the Air Force
that we will provide facilities...
...for any comments, criticisms,
or corrections it may wish to make...
...as to the case of Milo Radulovich.
We are unable to judge the charges
against his father or sister...
...because neither we, nor you,
nor they, nor the lawyers...
...nor the Lieutenant, know what was
contained in that manila envelope.
Was it hearsay,
rumor, gossip, slander...
...or hard ascertainable facts that
could be backed by credible witnesses?
We do not know.
We believe the son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father.
Even though that iniquity be proved
and in this case it was not.
But we believe too that this case
illustrates the urgent need...
...for the Armed Forces to communicate
more fully than they have so far done...
...the procedures and regulations
to be followed...
...in attempting to protect
the national security...
...and the rights of the individual
at the same time.
Whatever happens in this area
of the relationship...
...between the individual
and the state...
...we will do it ourselves...
...it cannot be blamed on Malenkov
or Mao Tse-Tung or even our allies.
And, it seems to us,
Fred Friendly and myself...
...that this is a subject
that should be argued about endlessly.
Good night, and good luck.
And we'reout.
May I tell you something
about yourself...
May I tellyou something
about yourself...
...as a member
of the "Person to Person" audience?
Based on audience
research studies...
...you are well above average
in education and intelligence.
Your interests are wide,
from world affairs and science...
...to sports and show business.
And you have one characteristic
that's rather encouraging to me...
...and that's the fact that you are
not easily persuaded by advertising.
The makers of Kent considered
all these characteristics...
...when they chose
Mr. Murrow'sprogram...
...to tell you about Kent.
Of all leading filter cigarettes,
Kent filter's best.
If you try Kent with that in mind,
I think you'll agree...
...with many other thinking people
who havec hanged to Kent.
They find that it makes good sense
to smoke Kent and good smoking, too.
Did you get the changes?
Edward Murrow, "Person to Person"...
...on the CBS Television Network.
No, no. You there? Okay. We got it.
Now back to Ed Murrow.
Not since the silent movies
and the idols they produced...
...has Hollywood witnessed the sort
of pilgrimage that is now going on.
Each day, oblivious to time,
weather, and the state of the world...
...sightseers head in the direction
of California's San Fernando Valley.
For there, at the end
of the tourist line, is Sherman Oaks...
...and the home Liberace
has built for himself and his mother.
This is the front and nobody knows
how many people have seen that view.
This is the back of the house
and that's Liberace's bedroom.
Good evening, Lee.
Good evening, Ed.
What are you doing? - I'm dictating
my weekly syndicated newspaper column...
...and on my trusty tape recorder here,
I'm also dictating a book.
It's an inspirational book.
Lee, what about you?
Have you given much thought
to getting married and settling down?
Actually, I've given
a lot of thought to it...
...but I don't believe in getting married
just for the sake of getting married.
I want to someday
find the perfect mate...
...and settle down to what I hope will
be a marriage that will be blessed...
and will be a lasting union.
I was reading
about lovely young Princess Margaret...
...and she's lookng
for her dream man, too...
...and I hope she finds him someday.
Uh-huh. Lee, thanks very much
for letting us come and visit you.
It's been very pleasant.
And will you say goodnight
to your family for us?
I certainly will.
Thanks a lot.
Good night, Ed.
Good night, Lee.
Next week, we'll take you
to Beverly Hills, California...
...to the house of Mickey Rooney
and his newbride.
Until then,
good night, and good luck.
Good show, Mr. Murrow!
Excuse me, Mr. Murrow.
Could you take a look at this
and sign it for me, please?
Thank you. Dr. Stanton
would like to have a drink with you.
When?
Now. He's at the Pentagon Bar.
I can't. What the hell
is he doing there?
I believe he's waiting for you.
Just call him! - Fine.
Oppenheimer next week.
It's a good show, Ed.
Hey, Don!
You're getting good at this!
They're gonna think you like it!
Pays the bills. How are you, Don?
...day today.
If she saw how good you look
right now, she'd be back.
You tell her that
if you see her, will you?
I read the O'Brian piece.
Yeah, it's tough.
I'm a pinko.
I slant the news.
I'm just waiting for him
to say my wife left me too.
Nobody worth their salt reads him.
You read him.
Well, see, I rest my case.
Does Paley read him?
Bill Paley's not gonna do anything.
I just came by to tell you
how great the Lieutenant piece was.
Thanks. - How's the fallout?
Mostly good, surprisingly.
Is this the start?
Are you taking sides?
It's just a little poke
with a stick, see what happens.
You let me know if I can help.
But you're a pinko.
I'll see you.
Hey, Joe! What's all this
Radulovich junk you're putting out?
I can't talk to you now. I have
to get this film back to New York.
What would you say if I told you...
...that Murrow was
on the Soviet payroll in 1935?
Uh! Charlie, you wanna...
Sure. I'll set up outside.
McCarthy going
tot he Eisenhower dinner?
I have no idea. Id on't keep the
Senator's calendar for him! - Really?
Have you ever seen any spy films?
You don't hand me a classified folder!
You're supposed to slip it
into my briefcase!
I didnt know who to give
this information to, Paley or Murrow.
As you can imagine, Fred and I
aren't very friendly. No pun intended.
No pun elocuted.
What do you got, Donald?
In short?
Murrows been a Communist
sympathizer since the 1930's.
Member of the International Workers,
sponsored educational trips to Moscow...
...and on the Sovietpayroll
in 1935. It's all there.
You wanna know
why that's not possible?
Why you'll lose this one?
Because everyone in this country...
...knows that Ed Murrow
is a loyal American, he's apatriot.
Did you know the word "gullible"
isn't in the dictionary?
Can I give this to him?
I'd love it! I have copies!
I think you guys go too far.
Well, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck.
Yes, Mr. Paley.
Right away.
Yes, sir.
No, he hasn't called.
Yes, sir, the second he calls.
If you're in a meeting, shall I?
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.
Mr. Murrow!
Mr. Paley will see you now.
Mr. Paley, Mr. Murrow is here.
Thanks, Miss Mary.
Hello, Ed. - Bill...
Sit over here, will you?
How's Janet?
Your son?
All well, thanks. How's Babe?
She's fine. Her fundraiser
got rained on, so...
Oh! That's why I never plan
on anything. - Really?
You'd never know.
Reading fiction?
I hope so. You tell me.
Now we know
how they're gonna come at us.
That's just the first shot.
Somebody's going to go down.
Have you checked your facts?
Are you on safe ground?
Bill, it's time. Show our cards.
My cards.
You lose, what happens?
5 guys find themselves out of work.
I'm responsible for a lot more
than 5 goddamn reporters. Let it go.
McCarthy will self-destruct,
Cohn, all of them.
You said Corporate
would not interfere with Editorial...
...and that the News
was to be left...
We don't make the news,
we report the news.
He's marked as Communists.
If he goes too far,
the Senate will investigate him...
...and we will report on that.
He oversteps people's civil liberties.
And you're trying him in the press?
Does he get the right
to face his accuser?
You've decided on this
and you're presenting it as fact.
What I am doing...
I write your check.
I put you in your country house,
and I put your son through school!
You should have told me about this
before it went so far down the road!
Everyone of your boys needs to be
clean. Do you understand? No ties.
If Aaron's mother went to a group
fundraiser in 1932, he's out.
Hewitt, too. Anyone in that room.
You make no mistake...
...I will cut them loose. Corporate
won't interfere with Editorial.
But Editorial will not jeopardize
the hundreds of employees...
...of the CBS.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes?
Fellas, our next show is gonna be
about Senator McCarthy.
And we'regonna go right at him.
I don't need to tell you
how careful we have to be.
If we are to do this, Ed and I
need you to be straight with us.
We need to know,
for the good of the piece...
...if any of you have any connection,
if you subscribed to a newsletter...
...if you attended a party,
...anything that could compromise this,
anything at all...
...because now would be
the time to tell us.
Ed, I think I should excuse myself.
Palmer, you kidding?
My ex was a...
I wouldn't say she was a Communist...
...but she attended meetings.
It was before we were married.
I didn't even really know about it
until after the divorce.
But it was different then.
We were all on the same side.
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know. The thing is...
...somebody'll find out.
They'll hurt us with it.
I should have told you sooner, Ed,
I'm sorry.
Fred.
If none of us had ever read
a "dangerous" book...
...or had a friend
who was "different"...
...or never joined an organization
that advocated "change"...
...we'd all be the kindof people
Joe McCarthy wants.
We're gonna go with the story,
because the terror is in this room.
John! Jesse!
Go through the HUAC hearings.
Eddie! Palmer! Look at who
did the interviews and any speeches.
Okay, fellas, here we go.
His own words,
that's what we need.
...said that he wouldn't remove
a General from the Army...
...who supported a Communist Major.
I said, "Then, General... "
"... you should be removed
from any command. "
"Any man who says, "I will protect
and honor a General'... "
"... 'who protects Communists', is not
fit to wear that uniform, General. "
Ethically, we're fine.
But legally, if we air this, are we
leaking closed hearing testimony?
But he chose to read it.
We're not misquoting him.
There are other reporters.
If it's a legal issue, it's his.
I'll check with Campbell in Legal.
And wait till you hear
the bleeding hearts...
...scream and cry about our methods...
...of trying to drag the truth...
...from those who know
or should know...
...who covered up
a Fifth Amendment Communist Major.
But they say, "Oh... "
"... it's all right to uncover them,
but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy. "
Did a Civil Liberties Union provide
you with an attorney at that time?
I had many offers of attorneys...
...and from the American Civil Liberties
Union, too. - The question is:
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?
They did supply an attorney.
The answer is yes?
The answer is yes.
You know the Civil Liberties Union
has been listed...
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?
Mr. Chairman, this was 1932!
I know this was in 1932.
Do you know that they since
have been listed...
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?
I do not know
that they have been listedso, sir.
You don't know?
I have heard that mentioned...
All right, Leo. Turn it off.
I need those three cans of Stevens!
Has anybody read this book yet?
It would be nice
if this guy isn't a Commie.
Did Millie give it to you?
I wanna read the book.
Nobody else, Joe.
I hear you, boss.
I'll put it on a kinescope,
push through the end.
Palmer, cut it at 2:30.
I prefer it one on each end,
let it run through.
It'd be more powerful.
Cut Kennedy?
Joe, file it for me.
I'll see the Mundt piece later.
Are we gonna make it, Fred?
We lost the telecine,
but we'll make it.
Did you finish your closing piece?
It's Shakespeare.
Write your closing.
My argument was if you just show
the images of McCarthy...
...it doesn't make any difference.
If you agree with him,
you're gonna hate the piece.
If you don't, you'll love it.
Maybe they should wait
till they get more footage.
I don't think
wec an take that chance.
We've got to hit McCarthy
before he comes after Ed.
The blue one. They haven't gone
after the Alsops or Herb Block.
Honey, the Alsops and Herb Block...
...didn't work for the Institute
of International Education in 1934.
Then I guess it's time.
You worried?
I didn't think I was.
I don't know why.
I was in the office on Friday.
And I answered the phone,
it was Howard calling from London.
And he asked what was going on
with McCarthy.
And before I answered him, I turned
and looked over my shoulder...
...tosee who was listening.
And who was listening?
Chairman Mao...
I'll see you at the office.
Hey, your ring!
Name me another wife...
...who reminds her husband
to take off his wedding ring...
...before he goes to the office.
Ava Gardner.
Excuse me, Mr. Friendly. Mr. Murrow,
Mr. Paley's on the line for you.
Maybe he wants to reimburse us
for those ads. - You'd like that!
I would like that!
There's a Knickerbocker game tonight.
I've got front row seats.
Are you interested?
I'm busy bringing down
the network tonight, Bill.
Is that tonight?
We're covered, Bill.
All right.
I'm with you today, Ed, and I'm
with you tomorrow. - Thanks, Bill.
Do you know the timing
on the first piece?
Can we hold all the calls, please?
Hold the calls till after the show.
Thank you.
You fellas, awake down there?
Just... what are we? 20?
30 seconds, Ed.
10 seconds.
And pan, camera one.
Because a report on Senator McCarthy
is by definition controversial...
...we want to say exactly
what we mean to say...
...and request your permission
to read from a script...
...what ever remarks Murrow
and Friendly may make.
If the Senator feels that we have done
violence to his words or pictures...
...and desires to answer himself...
...an opportunity will be afforded him
on this program.
Our working thesis tonight
is this quotation:
against Communism... "
"... has made a fight between
America's two great political parties... "
"... the American people know that one
of these parties will be destroyed... "
"... and the Republic cannot endure
very long as a one-party system. "
We applaud that statement...
...and we think
Senator McCarthy ought to.
He said it
17 months ago in Milwaukee.
The American people realize
that this cannot be made a fight...
...between America's
two great political parties.
If this fight against Communism...
...is made a fight against America's
two great political parties...
...the American people know that one
of those parties will be destroyed...
...and the Republic can't endure
very long as a one-party system.
On one thing the Senator
has been consistent.
Often operating as a one-man
committee, he has traveled far...
...interviewed many,
terrorized some...
...accused civilian
and military leaders...
...of the past administration
of a great conspiracy...
...to turn over the country
to Communism.
I was extremely shocked when I heard
that Secretary Stevens...
...told 2 Army officers that they had
to take part in the cover up...
...of those who promoted
and coddled Communists.
As I read his statement, I...
...thought of that quotation,
On what meat... 
"... does this our Caesar feed?".
The questions is:
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?
They did supply an attorney.
The answer is yes?
The answer is yes.
Do you think this book
did considerable harm?
Its publication...
...by an expression of the views
contained in it?
The sale of that book
was so abysmally small...
...it was so unsuccessful,
that the question of its influence...
You can go back
to the publisher...
...you'll see it was one of the most
unsuccessful books he ever put out.
He's still sorry about it,
Well, I think that's a compliment
to American intelligence.
I'll say that.
The Reed Harris hearing demonstrates
one of the Senator's techniques.
Twice he said...
...'The American Civil Liberties Union
was listed as a subversive front. "
The Attorney General's list does not
and never has listed...
...the ACLU as subversive,
nor does the FBI...
...or any other
federal government agency.
And the American Civil Liberties Union
holds in its files...
...letters of commendation
from President Truman...
...President Eisenhower,
and General MacArthur.
Earlier, the Senator asked, "Upon what
meat does this our Caesar feed?".
Had he looked three lines earlier
in Shakespeare's "Caesar"...
...he would have found this line,
which is not altogether inappropriate.
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves. "
No one familiar with the history
of this country...
...can deny that Congressional
committees are useful.
It is necessary to investigate
before legislating...
...but the line between investigating
and persecuting is a very fine one...
...and the junior Senator from Wisconsin
has stepped over it repeatedly.
We must not confuse dissent
with disloyalty.
We must remember always
that accusation is not proof...
...and that conviction depends
upon evidence and due process of law.
We will not walk in fear,
one of another.
We will not be driven by fear
into an age of unreason...
...if we dig deep
in our history and doctrine...
...and remember that we are not
descended from fearful men...
...not from men who feared to write,
to associate, to speak...
...and to defend the causes
that were for the moment unpopular.
This is no time for men who oppose
Senator McCarthy's methods...
...to keep silent,
or for those who approve.
Wec an deny our heritage
and our history...
...but we cannot escape
responsibility for the results.
We proclaim ourselves,
indeed as we are...
...the defenders of freedom wherever
it continues to exist in the world...
...but we cannot defend freedom abroad
by deserting it at home.
The actions of the junior Senator
from Wisconsin...
...have caused alarm and dismay
amongst our allies abroad...
...and given considerable comfort
to our enemies.
And whose fault is that?
Not really his.
He didn't create
this situation of fear...
...he merely exploited it,
and rather successfully.
Cassius was right.
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves. "
Good night, and good luck.
And we're out.
Nothing?
Maybe nobody watched.
We got nothing.
I don't know. - Nothing.
Should I turn the phones back on,
Mr. Williams?
Yes. Now would be
a good time for that.
Turn the phones on!
Turn the pho...
Mr. Friendly wants the phones on.
It's the Junior Senator
calling collect.
Don't kid yourself. It's Reed Harris
thanking us for mentioning him.
I don't know whether all of you
have seen what I just saw...
...but I want to associate myself
and this program...
...with what Ed Murrow
...and say I have never been
prouder of CBS.
Senator McCarthy said today that he
would demand equal free television...
Stevenson had charged that the Senator
made demagoguery and deceit...
...the national policy...
Is that Hollenbeck?
Congratulations!
Great show!
Feel like a Scotch?
I think everybody
could use a Scotch.
It's 3:30, early editions are out.
I'm not worried about that.
Of course not.
Shirley, honey...
...would you go across the street
and get the early editions?
All of them?
Just get O'Brian!
Hey, watch my drink!
Yeah.
Okay. Here we go.
At last!
The Times. - The Times...
First?
Good.
Who wrote it?
Jack Gould.
Gould...
Edward R. Murrows television program
on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy...
...was an exciting and provocative
examination of the man and his methods.
It was crusading journalism
of high responsibility and courage.
For TV so often plagued
by timidity and hesitation...
...the program was a milestone
that reflected enlightened citizenship.
The program... Hold on!
The program was no less
an indictment of those who wish...
...the problems posed
by the Senator's tactics and theatrics...
...would just go away
and leave them alone.
That was Mr. Murrows
and television's triumph...
...and a very great one.
Here! Here!
He hated it.
Yeah. What's his beef?
Send the New YorkTimes
abottle of Scotch.
I already did. How do you think
we got that review?
How's the Post?
Pretty good!
What about O'Brian?
Uh, the same.
Goon, read O'Brian!
I don't have it.
Got it.
Oh. Here.
There we go.
Shirley, that...
We can't say we were surprised at
Murrows "Hate McCarthy" telecast...
...last evening, when his explosively
one-sided propaganda...
...edited with deviously clever
selectivity from McCarthy's march...
...against Communism,
was finished last evening...
...by equally Machiavellian coincidence
the following telecast...
...featured Murrow's PM protege,
Hollenbeck.
In an obviously gloating mood,
Hollenbeck...
...hoped viewers had witnessed
his patron's triumph...
...from and for the Left.
Soon. Soon...
Shirley, it's okay.
Go ahead, finish it.
No, that's it. That's it.
Shirley, please, finish it.
The CBS has been in a lengthy
"clean house of Lefties" mood.
The worst offenders
on lesser levels...
...have been quietly
pushed out of the company.
Don Hollenbeck, a graduate
of the demised pinko publication PM...
...attacked conservative papers
with sly and slanted propaganda.
He then proceeded
through an equally...
...tilted review of the day's events...
...with McCarthy dominating his words,
actions, attitudes.
Soon.
It's O'Brian. - He didn't get
the Scotch, that's all.
Is it grammatically correct?
I'll have that cigarette, Ed.
Thanks, Shirley.
Oh. - Mmh. - Thank you.
Joe... Shirley...
It doesn't matter.
To Jack Gould!
To Jack! To Jack! To Jack Gould!
To Jack Gould!
I love Jack Gould!
May he rest in peace.
Hello, Jimmy.
Fred, congratulations! - Thank you.
I got such a hangover
to go along with the ulcer.
All the adguys on the 3rd floor
watched the show.
Got a good review
in the New York Times. Jack Gould.
We're putting out a press release...
...saying that calls came in
15 to 1 in favor of the show. - Really?
Yeah. - 15 to 1?
We got calls from everywhere.
East Coast or West Coast?
Yeah. Kansas City, Cincinnati...
Mr. Paley...
Morning, Fred.
Morning, Mr. Paley.
How's your wife?
She's fine.
We're getting ready to move.
Really? Where to? - Riverdale.
We found a nice house there.
It's nice there.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me.
Fred! McCarthy wants William Buckey
to do his rebuttal.
I said no.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Johnny!
Radulovich has been reinstated.
Radulovich... Guys!
Radulovich has been reinstated.
Jesse! Jesse!
Where is Ed?
He's in the bullpen. Why?
What's going on? - Jess!
Got some very good news.
Special announcement
from the Secretary of the Air Force!
Fellas! Listen up! Everyone!
I have decided
that it is consistent...
...with the interests
of the National Security to retain...
...Lieutenant Radulovich
in the United States Air Force. Stop.
He is not, in my opinion,
a security risk. Fullstop.
There you go. Harold E. Talbott,
Secretary from the Air Force.
Great job!
Make a copy of that for me!
I will do, Fred!
Back to work, guys!
We got a lot of work to do.
This means something.
Good news, huh?
Congratulations!
This absolutely means something.
Absolutely. This is the start of...
Palmer!
The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you.
When?
Tomorrow.
I don't want you to get paranoid,
they're talking to everybody.
Any ideas?
Just tell them what you know.
Now is that testimony true?
No, sir, it is not.
Not at any time have I been
a member of the Communist Party...
...and I have never seen
a Communist card.
You've never seen a Communist card?
That's right.
Have you ever attended
any Communist meetings?
No, sir, never.
Have you ever subscribed
to The Daily Worker?
No, sir. I didn't subscribe to it
and I wouldn't pay for it.
Uh... Now, Mrs. Markward,
who was working for the FBI...
...who joined the Communist Party
under orders from the FBI...
...has testified that while
she never met you personally...
...at a Communist meeting
that your name was on the list...
...of Communists
who were paying dues.
Uh... Can you shed
any light upon that?
No, sir. I don't even know
what the dues are...
...or where they were paid.
So you have never paid any money...
...to the Communist Party.
Is that correct?
That's right.
You've never paid
any dues, payment...
Thank you very much, Leo!
Good work, Joe, Charlie.
Now what is the show?
Is it defending Annie Lee Moss
as not being a Communist?
Or is ither Constitutional rights?
Both. - The latter.
We're much better sticking out
the Constitutional issues.
Agreed?
The woman is not a Communist spy.
Joe McCarthy said that they have
a spy in the Pentagon...
...that spy has gotten
into the code room...
is Annie Lee Moss.
I've got New York Times reports.
McCarthy asserts he has...
...a new red link to Army. Quote,
Senator McCarthy charged today... 
"... that the Army now employs
a woman in its code room... "
"... who was, and still may be,
an active Communist. "
It's the front page
of the New York Times.
No sooner is he done chastising the
other committee members for wanting...
...to push into the afternoon,
than what? Seven questions in...
...he ducks out, leaves...
Heleaves. - It's all over
the headlines, all over the country.
Get me copies from any newspaper...
...that printed anything
about that assertion.
That's a good idea. You should get
the Cincinnati Inquirer.
Chicago. - Couple other pieces
I think we should include.
The fact that there's 3 Annie Lee Moss's
in the phone book.
There are 2 Robert Halls,
one's colored, one's white.
We have some footage
of the empty chair.
I think that says it all.
Just that picture of McCarthy not...
McCarthy leaving the hearing
after 7 questions...
...and then we'll cut
to the shot of thechair.
We gotta do something about it.
All right, so...
Excuse me. Mr. Murrow!
McCarthy wants April 6th.
Thank you, Natalie.
Fine. If Charlie shoots it, we get
to see it first. We should offer.
It's a long shot.
What the hell could McCarthy do?
Is he gonna debate himself?
We just used his words!
Johnny! Johnny! We know
what it's going to be.
He's going to come after me.
There's nothing more he can do.
He's gonna bet that
a Senator trumps a newsman.
He'll lose.
Not if we're playing bridge.
I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean
to interrupt. - Hey, Don.
It's getting fun now!
Ed, you have aminute?
Yes, I'll be right there.
All right, boys. Playtime's over.
We have 4 days...
...to do a 29 minute show.
Yeah. - All right.
All right, go ahead.
Hi, Mary.
Hello, Mr. Hollenbeck.
Mr. Murrow...
Could you give us a moment?
Sure.
Thank you, dear.
I have to ask you something, Ed.
It's about O'Brian.
O'Brian doesn'tmatter.
He's killing me, Ed.
He doesn't amount to that much
in the newsroom.
We've got to let that guy have it.
We're not going after O'Brian. I will
not take on McCarthy and Hearst.
I can't defeat them both.
Just don't read the papers.
Or don't read O'Brian, anyway.
Okay. I guess not.
Sorry, Don.
Although Mrs. Moss
offered to testify...
...Senator McCarthy suggested
that she was too sick.
She agreed... - Mr. Cohn wanted
to know about Mrs. Moss's connection...
...to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth...
...so help you God?
May we get your full name
for the record, please?
Annie Lee Moss.
That's right.
Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record,
for your information...
...for the information
of your counsel...
...that you are not here because...
...you are considered important
in the Communist apparatus.
We have the testimony that you are,
and have been, a Communist.
We are rather curious, however,
to kno whow you suddenly...
...were shifted from...
...a worker in a cafeteria
to the code room.
I am today much more interested...
...in the handling of your case...
...by your superiors
than in your own personal activities.
However, counsel will question you
about your own activities also.
Mr. Chairman!
We will not hear from counsel.
You have been told what the rule is.
If you have anything to say,
say it through your client.
Chairman. Did you begin work
at the General Accounting Office in...
Yes, sir.
And, prior to that time,
had you been a cafeteria worker?
Yes, I had.
I see. While in the Pentagon,
since 1950...
...have you had any connections
with coded messages?
Have you ever handled
coded messages?
No more than to transmit 'em.
Pardon me?
No more than to transmit
the message.
Than to transmit them?
Did you transmit codes?
To receive or transmit messages
was all I had to do.
And I've never been
into a courtroom in my life.
Do you know the...
...type of classification...
Do you know if they were secret,
top secret, confidential? - No, sir.
You wouldn't know the degree
of classification? - No, sir.
I see.
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to excuse myself, I've got...
...a rather important appointment
to work on right now...
...and I wonder if, Senator Mundt,
you would takeover as Chairman?
Chairman. Uh...
Cohn.
I have no further questions
of this witness at this time.
We have the testimony of Mrs. Markward,
the undercover agent for the FBI...
...stating that Annie Lee Moss
was a member, a dues-paying member...
...of the Communist Party...
...the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.
We have corroboration
of that testimony by another...
...witness who was called
before the Committee...
...and gave a sworn statement
to the effect...
...that she also knew Mrs. Moss
as a member...
...of the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.
She's already lost her job. She's been
suspended because of this action.
I'm not defending her. If she's
a Communist, I want her exposed.
But to make these statements
as we've got corroborating evidence...
...that she is a Communist,
under these circumstances...
...I think she's entitled to have it
produced here in her presence...
...and let the public know about it
and let her know about it.
I don't like to try people
by hearsay evidence.
I'd like to get the witnesses here
and try them...
...by testimony, under oath.
The Chair will rule
that the comment of Mr. Cohn...
...be stricken from the record.
I didnt ask that, Mr. Chairman!
...whether we should try to produce
a witness in public...
...because the FBI may have
her undercover and we don't want to...
You can't strike these statements
made by counsel here as to evidence...
...that we're having and withholding.
You cannot strike that from the press...
...nor from the public mind
once it's planted there. That's the...
...evil of it!
Well, I'd look at it...
I don't think it's fair to a witness...
...to a citizen of this country...
...to bring them up here
and cross-examine them...
...then when they get through, say...
..."The FBI has got something on you
that condemns you. "
The Chair agrees...
It is not sworn testimony...
...it's convicting people
by rumor and hearsay and innuendo.
You will notice that neither Senator
McClellan or Senator Symington...
...nor this reporter know or claim
that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist.
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.
One month ago tonight we presented
a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.
We labeled it as controversial.
Most of that report consisted
of words and pictures of the Senator.
At that time, we said...
..."If theSenator believes we havedone
violence to his words or pictures... "
"... if he desires to speak,
to answer himself... "
"... an opportunity would be
afforded him on this program. "
The Senator sought the opportunity
after 3 weeks...
...because he was very busy and wished
adequate time to prepare his reply.
We agreed.
We placed no restrictions on the manner
of the presentation of his reply...
...and we suggested that we would not
take time to comment...
...on this particular program.
Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,
junior Senator from Wisconsin.
Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow,
Educational Director of the CBS...
...devoted his program
to an attack...
...on the work ofthe US Senate
Investigating Committee...
...and on me personally
as its Chairman.
Now, over the past 4 years,
he has made repeated attacks upon me...
...and those fighting Communists.
Of course, neither Joe McCarthy
nor Edward R. Murrow...
...is of any great importance
as individuals.
We are only important...
...in our relation to the great struggle
to preserve our American liberties.
Now ordinarily, I wouldnt take time
out from the important work at hand...
...to answer Murrow.
However, in this case...
...I feel justified in doing so
because Murrow is the symbol...
...the leader...
...and the cleverest of the jackal pack
which is always found at the throat...
...of anyone who dares to expose
individual Communists and traitors.
And I am compelled by the fact...
...to say to you
that Mr. Edward R. Murrow...
...as far back as 20 years ago...
...was engaged in propaganda
for Communist causes.
For example, the Institute
of International Education...
...of which he was
the Acting Director...
...was chosen to act
as a representative...
...by a Soviet agency...
...to do a job which would normally
be done by the Russian secret police.
Mr. Murrow, by his own admission,
was a member of the IWW...
...that's the Industrial Workers
of the World...
...a terrorist organization
cited as subversive...
...by an Attorney General
of the United States.
Mr. Murrow said on this program
and I quote...
..."The actions of the junior
Senator from Wisconsin... "
"... have given considerable comfort
to the enemy. "
That is the language of our statute
of treason, rather strong language.
If I am giving comfort to our enemies,
I ought not to be in the Senate.
If, on the other hand,
Mr. Murrow...
...is giving comfort to our enemies...
...he ought not to be brought
into the homes...
...of millions of Americans
by the CBS.
And I want to assure you...
...that I will not be deterred...
...by the attacks of the Murrows,
the Lattimores, the Fosters...
...The Daily Worker
or the Communist Party itself.
And I make no claim to leadership.
Incomplete humility...
...I do ask you and every American
who loves this country...
...to join with me.
The aluminum from the nation's
Last week, Senator McCarthy
appeared on this program...
...to correct any errors
he might have thought we made...
...in our report of March 9th.
Since he made no reference to any
statements of fact that we made...
...we must conclude
that he found no errors of fact.
He proved again
that anyone who exposes him...
...anyone who doesn't share his disregard
for decency and human dignity...
...and the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution...
...must be either a Communist
or a fellow traveler.
I fully expected this treatment.
The Senator added this reporter's name
to a long list of individuals...
...and institutions he has accused
of serving the Communist cause.
His proposition is very simple:
...anyone who criticizes or opposes
Senator McCarthy's methods...
...must be a Communist.
And if that be true, there are
an awful lot of Communists in the USA.
For the record, let's consider briefly
some of the Senator's charges.
He claimed, but offered no proof...
...that I had been a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World.
That is false.
I was never a member ofthe IWW,
never applied for membership.
The Senator charged
that Professor Harold Laski...
...a British scholar and politician,
dedicated a book to me.
That's true.
He is dead.
He was a socialist, I am not.
He was a civilized individual...
...who did not insist upon agreement
with his political principles...
...as a pre-condition
for conversation or friendship.
I do not agree
with his political ideas.
I ask, as he makes clear
in the introduction...
...dedicated the book to me,
not because of political agreement...
...but because he held my wartime
broadcast from London in high regard.
And the dedication so reads.
I believed 20 years ago
and I believe today...
...that mature Americans can engage
in conversation and controversy...
...the clash of ideas, with Communists
anywhere in the world...
...without becoming
contaminated or converted.
I believe that our faith,
our conviction...
...our determination
are stronger than theirs...
...and that we can successfully compete,
not only in the area of bombs...
...but in the area of ideas.
I have worked with CBS
for more than 19 years.
The company has subscribed fully
to my integrity and responsibility...
...as a broadcaster
and as a loyal American.
I require no lectures from the junior
Senator from Wisconsin...
...as to the dangers
or terrors of Communism.
Having searched my conscience
and my files...
...I cannot contend that
I have always been right or wise...
...but I have attempted to pursue
thet ruth with diligence...
...and to report it...
...even though, as in this case,
I had been warned in advance...
...that I would be subjected
to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.
We shall hope to deal with matters
of more vital interest next week.
Good night, and good luck.
In the last analysis, the Senator was
perched on the television high dive...
...and all prepared
to make a resounding splash.
He jumped beautifully,
but he neglected to check first...
...where he was going to land.
It must have been a shock...
...to discover that Mr. Murrow
had drained the water out of the pool.
Is that the Times? Gould?
Yeah, it's Jack Gould.
He's a hell of a writer.
Yes, he is.
If we can afford him!
Stanton's got a public opinion...
Senate's investigating McCarthy.
The Army's charging that McCarthy
and Cohn exercised undue pressure...
...to get preferential treatment
for Schine. - Who's the source?
Got a second source? - There isn't,
but this is coming out in 2 hours.
Who's heading up the investigation?
It's not gonna be McCarthy!
Really?
What happened?
Also get me the Washington Post!
What's going on?
It's Williams
for Jack Thompson.
The Senate's investigating McCarthy.
There is an added bit of comedy
to this whole story.
The Committee cannot convene
for several days...
...because Senator McCarthy
has a slight case of laryngitis.
And he must recover
over the desert air of Arizona.
But Stevens is going after him
and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah.
They're gonna allow each side
to call witnesses...
...and be privy to other testimony.
Fred, we still have a meeting!
We're gonna go to talk toThompson.
No, thanks, Jack. Bye.
Freddy, we're a hit.
Right up there with "Howdy Dowdy"!
Can I have
an outlet satellite, please?
74, 76,47. Thank you.
Murrayville3, 1-2-7-6.
The fact of newscaster
Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday...
...does not remove from the record
that peculiar history...
...of the leftist slanting of news
indulged consistently by the CBS.
Hollenbeck was what most astute
students of CBS's strange...
...and questionable new methods
considered...
..."typical of its newscasters".
By Jack O'Brian.
Oh, yeah. I like it like that.
One of the best programs I ever heard
was called "CBS Views The Press".
A great many people liked it,
some didn't...
...but noone ever called it
anything but honest.
It was the work of an honest reporter.
Don Hollenbeck.
He also worked occasionally
on "See It Now'.
He did the 11 p.m. News
over some of these stations.
He had been sick lately
and he died this morning.
The police said
it was suicide... gas.
Not much of an obit.
But, at least we got our facts
straight, and it was brief.
And that's all Don Hollenbeck
would have asked.
Good night, and good luck.
Got to be in Philadelphia
this morning.
What time is your train?
Charlie going with you?
Here's a thought.
What if we're wrong?
We're not wrong.
We're not going to look back...
...and say we protected
the wrong side?
Protected them from what? In the name
of what? What would we be preserving?
Argument could bemade,
'for the greater good".
Not once you give it all away.
It's no good then.
It's just a thought.
Senator, may we not drop this? We know
he belonged to the Lawyer's Guild.
And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me.
I did you, I think, no personal
injury, Mr. Cohn. - No, sir.
I meant to do you
no personal injury. - No.
And if I did, I beg your pardon.
Let us not assassinate this lad
further, Senator. You've done enough.
Let's... let's...
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left
no sense of decency?
I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.
Senator, I think it hurts you, too.
I'd like to finish this.
Have you some private reservation...
...when you take the oath
that you will tell the whole truth...
...that lets you be the judge
of what you will testify to?
The answer is there's no reservation
about telling the whole truth.
Thank you, sir. Then tell us
who delivered the documents to you!
I don't want to mean that
this new fashion is not chic.
I think it's just no good for me.
Uh, not for you.
Milko, anything you care to say
on that subject?
I think no comment.
It's got to be there. If you can't
find it, I cant write about it.
Check again.
Charlie said he dropped it off.
Charlie said he dropped...
Shirley, can I see you a minute?
I got to call you back.
Joe!
You, too.
Close the door.
Have a seat.
How are you?
Fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah.
Uh, you both are aware
that there's a policy at CBS...
...that no two employees
can be married.
I want to ask you a question,
but I don't want you to answer it.
I want you to consider it.
I know you two are married.
Everyone knows.
That's not my question.
In the next few weeks
I have to lay off a couple of people.
We're making some significant cuts
across the board.
I wanted you to know that...
...because you could save
someone else being fired.
I'm asking you to consider
makng this decision a little easier.
I don't need an answer now.
Just think about it.
Good.
Well, Joe...
Well?
Sure we'regonna miss you
around here. - I'll pack my things.
I think it's for the best.
We'll find out!
Mrs. Wershba...
Everybody knew.
Natalie, did he say
what it was about?
No. Just that he wanted to talk
to you in his office.
Uh-oh!
The problem isn't simply
that you've lost your sponsor.
With Alcoa, "See It Now"
still loses money.
The fee is 50,000 dollars.
Last week's episode we did
for less than 50,000 dollars.
Fred, you're speakng
beyond your competence.
We'll certainly find another sponsor.
"64,000 Dollar Question" brings in
over 90,000 in sponsors...
...and it costs one-third
of what youdo.
Ed, I've got Tuesday night
programming that's number one.
People want to enjoy themselves.
They don't want a civics lesson.
What do you want, Bill?
I don't want to get a stomachache...
...every time you take on
a controversial subject.
I'm afraid that's the price
you have to be willing to pay.
Let's walk very carefully
through these next few moments.
The content of what we're doing
is more important...
...than what some guy in Cincinnati...
It's what you'redoing, Ed. Not me.
Not Frank Stanton. You.
CBS News", "See It Now
all belong to you, Bill.
You wouldn't know it.
What is it you want? Credit?
I never censored a single program.
I hold on to affiliates
who wanted entertainment from us.
I fight to keep the license...
...with the very same politicians
that you are bringing down...
...and I never,
never said no to you. Never.
I would argue that we have done
very well by one another.
I would argue that this network...
...is defined by what the news
department has accomplished.
And I would also argue that never saying
no is not the same as not censoring.
Really? You should teach journalism.
You and Mr. Friendly.
Let me ask you this:
...why didn't you correct McCarthy...
...when he said that Alger Hiss
was convicted of treason?
He was only convicted of perjury.
You corrected everything else.
Did you not want the appearance
of defending a known Communist?
I would argue that everyone censors,
including you.
What do you want to do, Bill?
I'm takng your program
from a half an hour to an hour.
And it wont be a weekly program
and it won't be Tuesday nights.
When would it be?
Sunday afternoons.
How many episodes?
Why don't you just fire me, Bill?
I don't think
it's what either of us wants.
You owe me 5 shows.
You won't like the subject matter.
Probably not.
Fred, I'll need you for a moment.
Thank you, Mary.
Goodbye, Mr. Friendly.
He wants me to lay a few people off.
I'm sure he does.
Let's do our first show
about the downfall of television.
Senate's gonna vote to censure
McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably.
And then what happens?
He sits in the back row. - Right.
They keep him in the Senate.
They don't kick him out. - No, he stays.
Well, we might as well
go down swinging.
Did you know the most trusted man
in America is Milton Berle?
See, you should have worn a dress!
Howd does a Scotch sound?
Scotch sounds good.
Did you know Joe and Shirley
were married? - Sure.
Did everyone know?
Pretty much.
We are proud because
from the beginning of this nation...
...man can walk upright.
No matter who he is
or who she is.
He can walk upright
and meet his friend or his enemy.
And he does not fear
that because that enemy...
...may be in a position
of great power...
...that he can be suddenly
thrown in jail...
...to rott here without charges
and with no recourse to justice.
We have the Habeas Corpus Act
and we respect it.
I began by saying that our history
will be what we makeit.
If we go on as we are...
...then history will take its revenge,
and retribution will not limp...
...in catching up with us.
Just once in a while, let us exalt the
importance of ideas and information.
Let us dream to the extent of saying
that on a given Sunday night...
...the time normally
occupied by Ed Sullivan...
...is given over to a clinical survey
on the state of American education.
And a week or two later, the time
normally used by Steve Allen...
...is devoted to a thorough-going study
of American policy in the Middle East.
Would the corporate image of their
respective sponsors be damaged?
Would the shareholders rise up
in their wrath and complain?
Would anything happen...
...other than a few million people would
have received a little illumination...
...on subjects that may well determine
the future of this country...
...and therefore the future
of the corporations?
To those who say, "People wouldn't
look, they wouldn't be interested..."
"...they're tooc omplacent,
indifferent and insulated"...
...I can only reply: There is,
in one reporter's opinion...
...considerable evidence
against that contention.
But even if they are right,
what have they got to lose?
Because if they are right...
...and this instrument
is good for nothing...
...but to entertain,
amuse and insulate...
...then the tube is flickering now...
...and we will soon see
that the whole struggle is lost.
This instrument can teach.
It can illuminate
and it can even inspire.
But it can do so only to the extent
that humans are determined to use it...
Well, it works both ways.
We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.
The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem
wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.
In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges
and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.
I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.
Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,
has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.
This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.
The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.
We're still men.
Yes, we're men.
Men is what we are.
Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high
and his body upped the oestrogen.
That was where I fit...
They'll have to drain my pecs again.
..between those huge sweating tits
that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.
OK, you cry now.
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.
For six months, I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.
With insomnia, nothing's real.
Everything's far away.
Everything's a copy of a copy
of a copy.
When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.
The IBM Stellar Sphere.
The Microsoft Galaxy.
The Planet Starbucks.
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.
It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.
He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.
Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.
Yes. I'd like to order
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.
Please hold.
Anything clever,
like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,
I had to have it.
The Klipsk personal office unit.
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.
Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.
I'd flip through catalogues and wonder
"What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?"
I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...
Please hold.
..wherever.
We used to read pornography.
Now it was the Horchow collection.
No. You can't die of insomnia.
What about narcolepsy?
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.
You need to lighten up.
Can you please just give me something?
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.
Hey, come on.
You wanna see pain?
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.
See the guys with testicular cancer.
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
We never could agree on anything.
Well, I... She...
She had her first child last week.
A girl.
With... With her... With her new husband.
Thank God, you know...
I'm glad for her.
She deserves...
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.
Thank you, Thomas.
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.
And that gives me strength.
We give each other strength.
It's time for the one-on-ones.
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.
Could you find a partner?
And this is how I met the big moosie.
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.
My name is Bob.
Bob?
Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.
You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?
That was his idea.
I was a juicer.
You know, using steroids?
Diabonal and
Wisterol.
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.
And now I'm bankrupt.
I'm divorced.
My two grown kids
won't even return my phone calls.
Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.
Go ahead,... Cornelius.
You can cry.
And then... something happened.
I let go.
That's really good.
Lost in oblivion.
Dark and silent and complete.
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.
Babies don't sleep this well.
I became addicted.
people always assumed the worst.
They cried harder... then I cried harder.
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...
I wasn't really dying.
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.
I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.
It moves over your body, healing you.
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe
and step forward
through the back door of the room.
Where does it lead?
To your cave.
Step forward
into your cave.
That's right.
You're going deeper into your cave.
And you're going to find
your power animal.
Slide.
Every evening I died.
And every evening I was born again.
Resurrected.
Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.
Being there, pressed against his tits,
ready to cry.
This was my vacation.
And she
ruined everything.
This is cancer, right?
This chick, Marla Singer,
did not have testicular cancer.
She was a liar.
She had no diseases at all.
I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.
Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.
And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.
Marla,
the big tourist.
Her lie reflected my lie.
And suddenly, I felt nothing.
I couldn't cry. So once again,
I couldn't sleep.
Next group, after guided meditation,
after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,
I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!
I hadn't slept in four days.
We'll just let that dry...
When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.
And you're never really awake.
To begin tonight's communion,
Chloe would like to say a few words.
Oh, yeah. Chloe.
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around
being extra nice to everybody.
Well, I'm still here.
But I don't know for how long.
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.
But I've got some good news.
I no longer have any fear of death.
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
No-one will have sex with me.
I'm so close to the end,
and all I want is to get laid for the last time.
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,
and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
Thank you, Chloe.
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
Thank you, Chloe.
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.
You step inside your cave and you walk...
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.
Marla.
The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.
But you can't.
..deeper into your cave as you walk.
You feel a healing energy all around you.
Now find your power animal.
Slide.
OK. Let's partner up.
Pick someone special to you tonight.
Hey.
We need to talk.
Sure.
I'm onto you.
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
Sorry?
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, I know we're all dying.
But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
So?
So you're a tourist.
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.
I saw you at testicular cancer!
I saw you practising this.
Practising what?
Telling me off.
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?
I'll expose you.
Go ahead. I'll expose you.
Come together. Let yourselves cry.
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.
I've been coming for over a year.
Why do you do it?
I don't know.
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
Yeah. Yeah.
Share yourself... completely.
Look, you don't want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.
Really?
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.
You gotta find somewhere else to go.
Candystripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.
No, wait a second. Hold on.
We'll split up the week, OK?
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.
You're kidding.
I dunno. Am I?
No. No.
What do you want?
I'll take the parasites.
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.
I want brain parasites.
I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.
I want that.
You can't have the whole brain.
So far, you have four. I only have two.
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.
Now we both have three...
Hey! You left half your clothes.
What, are you selling those?
Yes!
I'm selling some clothes!
So! We each have three. That's six.
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.
The girl had done her homework.
No. No. I want bowel cancer.
That's your favorite too?
Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Look, we'll split it.
Take the first and third Sunday.
Deal.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
How's this for not making a big thing?
Hey, Marla!
Marla!
Maybe we should exchange numbers.
Should we?
We might wanna switch nights.
This is how I met Marla Singer.
Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?
You wake up at SeaTac.
You wake up at O'Hare.
Dallas Fort Worth.
Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.
This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.
You wake up at Air Harbor International.
If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,
could you wake up as a different person?
Everywhere I travel,
tiny life.
Single-serving sugar and cream.
Single pat of butter.
The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.
Shampoo-conditioner combos.
Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.
The people I meet on each flight,
they're single-serving friends.
Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together.
That's all we get.
Welcome!
On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.
The infant went through the windshield.
A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.
The rear differential locks up.
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.
The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.
Now, should we initiate a recall?
The father must have been huge.
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?
Very modern art.
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.
Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.
equals X.
If X is less than the cost of a recall,
we don't do one.
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
You wouldn't believe.
Which car company do you work for?
A major one.
Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.
Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you."
It's a lot of responsibility.
Wanna switch seats?
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particularjob.
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.
The illusion of safety.
Yeah. I guess so.
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?
So you can breathe.
Oxygen gets you high.
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.
It's all right here.
Emergency water landing, 600mph.
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
That's an interesting theory.
What do you do?
What do you mean?
What do you do for a living?
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
We have the exact same briefcase.
Soap.
Sorry?
I make and I sell soap.
The yardstick of civilization.
And this is how I met...
Tyler Durden.
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?
No, I did not. Is that true?
That's right.
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.
Really?
If one was so inclined.
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.
Everything on a plane is single-serving...
Oh, I get it. Very clever.
Thank you.
How's it working out for you?
Being clever?
Great.
Keep it up, then. Right up.
A question of etiquette.
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
How I came to live with Tyler is...
Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.
Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.
Sorry, throwers?
Baggage handlers.
But when a suitcase vibrates,
the throwers have got to call the police.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Nine times out of ten
it's an electric razor.
But... every once in a while
it's a dildo.
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.
We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never
your dildo.
I don't own...
I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.
My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.
Never mind.
Hey! That's my car!
Home was a condo on the 15th floor
of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.
The walls were solid concrete.
A foot of concrete is important
when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.
Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects
blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.
I suppose these things happen.
There's... nothing up there.
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
Do you have somebody you can call?
How embarrassing.
A houseful of condiments and no food.
The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out
letting out just a little bit of gas.
That gas could have filled the condo.
1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.
Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.
Yeah?
I can hear you breathing...
If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.
Hello?
Who's this?
Tyler?
Who is this?
We met... We met on the airplane.
We had the same suitcase?
The clever guy?
Oh, yeah. Right.
I called a second ago. There was no answer.
I'm at a payphone.
Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.
So what's up?
Well.
You're not gonna believe this.
You know, it could be worse.
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
There's always that. I don't know.
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.
That's the last sofa I'll need.
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
I was close to being complete.
Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
All gone.
All gone.
Do you know what a duvet is?
A comforter.
It's a blanket.
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?
No.
What are we, then?
I dunno. Consumers.
Right. We're consumers.
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,
television with 500 channels,
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.
Viagra. Olestra.
Martha Stewart.
Fuck Martha Stewart.
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.
I say never be complete.
I say stop being perfect.
I say let's evolve.
Let the chips fall where they may.
But that's me, and I could be wrong.
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...
The things you own end up owning you.
Do what you like, man.
Oh, it's late.
Hey, thanks for the beer.
Yeah, man.
I should find a hotel.
A hotel?
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.
Oh, hey. No, no, no.
Yes, you did. So just ask.
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
Would... Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yeah.
I want you to do me a favor.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.
Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us slept, he worked.
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment
that one reel ends and the next one begins.
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.
That's the cue for a changeover.
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.
Why would anyone want this shitjob?
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.
Nice, big cock.
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...
Go ahead, tell 'em.
You get the idea.
You just want me to hit you?
Come on. Do me this one favor.
I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
No. But that's a good thing.
You can't know yourself if you haven't!
I don't wanna die without any scars.
Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
Oh, God. This is crazy.
So go crazy! Let it rip.
I don't know about this.
I don't either.
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!
That's right.
Where? Like, in the face?
Surprise me.
This is so fucking stupid.
Motherfucker!
He hit me in the ear!
Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
Ow, Christ!
Why the ear, man?
I fucked it up.
No, that was perfect.
No, it's all right.
It really hurts.
Hit me again.
No, you hit me. Come on!
We should do this again sometime.
Where's your car?
What car?
I don't know how Tyler found that house
but he said he'd been there for a year.
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
Most of the windows were boarded up.
There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.
The stairs were ready to collapse.
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.
Neither would have surprised me.
Yep. That's you.
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
Yeah, thanks.
What a shithole.
Nothing worked.
Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.
There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.
That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.
What have we here?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.
By the end of the first month,
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.
Can I be next?
All right, man.
Lose the tie.
At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.
Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.
Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.
The previous occupant had been a shut-in.
Hey, man. What are you reading?
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing."
There's a whole series of these.
I Am Jill's Nipples.
I Am Jack's Colon.
I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack.
After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.
You could deal with anything.
Have you finished those reports?
If you could choose,
who would you fight?
I'd fight my boss, probably.
Really?
Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
I don't know my dad.
I mean, I know him, but...
He left when I was like, six years old.
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.
He did this every six years.
He changes city and starts a new family.
Fucker's setting up franchises!
My dad never went to college.
So it was real important that I go.
That sounds familiar.
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "Get ajob."
Same here.
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
Dad, now what?
He says, "I dunno. Get married."
You can't get married.
I'm a 30-year-old boy.
We're a generation of men raised by women.
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.
But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.
We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.
It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.
Polish my Scandinavian furniture.
I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.
I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.
But I wasn't.
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.
Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
Absolutely.
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
Because waste is a thief.
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?
You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.
It was right in everyone's face.
Tyler and I just made it visible.
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.
Tyler and I just gave it a name.
Come on, you've gotta go home!
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.
Gentlemen!
Welcome to Fight Club.
The first rule of Fight Club is
you do not talk about Fight Club.
The second rule of Fight Club is
you do not talk about Fight Club!
Third rule of Fight Club.
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
the fight is over. Fourth rule.
Only two guys to a fight.
Fifth rule.
One fight at a time, fellas.
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.
And the eighth and final rule.
If this is your first night at Fight Club
you have to fight.
This kid from work, Ricky,
couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.
Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...
Stop!
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.
But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.
Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,
I wouldn't be talking to the same man.
Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
Hemingway. You?
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
We all started seeing things differently.
Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,
trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
Is that what a man looks like?
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.
Now, self-destruction...
Excuse me.
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.
It wasn't about words.
The hysterical shouting was in tongues
like at a Pentecostal Church.
Stop!
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.
But nothing mattered.
Cool.
Afterwards, we all felt saved.
Hey, man. How about next week?
How about next month?!
Irvine, you're in the middle.
New guy, you too.
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.
He fell down some stairs.
I fell down some stairs.
Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.
OK. Any historical figure.
Good answer.
How about you?
Lincoln.
Lincoln?
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
Hello?
Where have you been the last eight weeks?
Marla?
How did you find me?
You left a forwarding number.
I haven't seen you at any support groups.
We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.
How do you know?
I cheated.
I found a new one.
Really?
It's for men only.
Like the testicle thing?
Look, this is a bad time.
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
They're really fucked-up people...
I'm on my way out.
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
I took what was left of a bottle.
It might have been too much.
Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.
So you're staying in tonight, then?
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?
Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.
I can hardly believe anything about last night.
What are you doing here?
This is my house.
What are you doing here?
Fuck you!
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
Limber, though.
Silly cooze.
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.
Guess who's on the other end?
I knew the story before he told me.
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Do you think it'll live up to its name?
Or will it just be a death hairball?
Prepare to evacuate soul.
Ten,
nine,... eight...
How could Tyler, of all people,
think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?
Five,
four...
Hang on.
You got here fast.
Did I call you?
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
Somebody called the cops.
Hey, where's 513?
End of the hall.
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.
She has lost faith in herself.
Miss Singer, let us help you!
She's a monster!
You have every reason to live.
She's infectious human waste!
Miss Singer!
Good luck trying to save her!
If I fall asleep,
I'm done for.
You're gonna have to keep me up
all night.
Un-fucking-believable.
He was obviously able to handle it.
You know what I mean, you fucked her.
No, I didn't.
Never?
No.
You're not into her, are you?
No! God, not at all.
I am Jack's raging bile duct.
Are you sure? You can tell me.
Believe me, I'm sure.
Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
That's good.
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
My God.
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.
How could Tyler not go for that?
The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
She invaded my support groups
and now my home.
Hey, hey. Sit down.
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.
Why would I...
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.
Now promise me. You promise?
Yeah, I promise.
Promise?
I just said, I promise! What...
That's three times you promised.
If only I had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,
none of this would have happened.
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!
I could have moved to another room.
On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.
What are you doing?
Just going to bed.
Wanna finish her off?
No. No, thank you.
I've found a cigarette.
Who were you talking to?
I became the calm little center of the world.
I was the Zen master.
I wrote little haiku poems.
I e-mailed them to everyone.
Is that your blood?
Some of it, yeah.
You can't smoke in here.
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.
Get yourself together.
I got right in everyone's hostile face.
Yes, these are bruises from fighting.
Yes, I'm comfortable with that.
I am enlightened.
You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,
move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,
and you have to come home to this.
Hello.
This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.
Yes.
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
No, I wasn't aware of that.
I am Jack's cold sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.
The dynamite
Dynamite?
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
Do you know what this means?
No, what does it mean?
It means it was home-made.
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.
The gas was just a detonator.
Who would go and do that?
I'll ask the questions.
Tell him.
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.
Excuse me. Are you there?
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?
Enemies?
Reject civilization,
especially material possessions.
Son, this is serious.
Yes, I know it's serious.
I mean that.
Yes, it's very serious.
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.
That condo was my life. OK?
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.
It was me!
I'd like to thank the Academy.
Is this not a good time for you?
Just tell him you fucking did it!
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.
Are you still there?
Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.
Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
You... dance all night.
Then you throw it away.
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
It was worth every penny.
It's a bridesmaid's dress.
Someone loved it intensely
for one day.
Then tossed it.
Like a Christmas tree.
So special.
Then
It's on the side of the road.
Tinsel still clinging to it.
Like a sex crime victim.
Underwear inside out.
Bound with electrical tape.
Well then, it suits you.
You can borrow it sometime.
Get rid of her.
What? You get rid of her!
Don't mention me.
I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.
I really think it's time you left.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Not that we don't love your visits.
You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
Gotta get off
Thanks. Bye.
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round
Gonna get, need to get...
Gotta get...
You kids!
Why do you still waste time with her?
I'll say this about Marla.
At least she's trying to hit bottom.
And I'm not?
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.
What are we doing tonight?
Tonight... we make soap.
Really?
To make soap, first we render fat.
The salt balance has to be just right
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.
Wait, what is this place?
A liposuction clinic.
Pay dirt!
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!
Oh, God!
Give me another one.
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.
Like in Boy Scouts.
It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
Keep stirring.
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.
Tyler was full of useful information.
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.
You know why?
No.
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.
May I see your hand, please?
This is a chemical burn.
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.
Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.
Don't shut the pain out.
Oh, God!
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.
I tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh.
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!
I get the point!
No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!
I am not!
Our fathers were our models for God.
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!
I agree!
Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
I'm getting water!
You can use water and make it worse or...
Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
Please let me up!
First, you have to give up.
First, you have to know, not fear,
know that some day, you're gonna die.
You don't know how this feels!
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.
Congratulations.
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.
Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.
God knows what they charged.
This is the best soap.
Why, thank you, Susan.
It was beautiful.
We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.
He was wearing his yellow tie.
I didn't wear a tie to work any more.
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club."
I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.
"The second rule..." Is this yours?
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.
You find this. What would you do?
Well, I gotta tell you,
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
and then stalk from office to office
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.
This might be someone
you've known for years.
Someone very, very close to you.
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.
And I used to be such a nice guy.
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.
Compliance and Liability.
My tit's gonna rot off.
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
What do you mean?
I need you to check for a lump in my breast.
Go to a hospital.
I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
I don't know about this, Marla.
Please.
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.
Where are they, exactly?
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
No, no.
I got one for you.
Thanks for the thought.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, nothing.
Right there?
Feel anything?
No.
Well, make sure.
OK, I'm pretty sure.
You feel nothing?
No, nothing.
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
No problem.
I wish I could return the favor.
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.
I could check your prostate.
Well, thanks, anyway.
Are we done?
Yeah, we're done.
See you... around.
Cornelius?
Cornelius!
It's me! Bob!
Hey, Bob.
We all thought you were dead.
No, no. Still here.
How are you, Bob?
Better than I've ever been in my whole life.
Really? Still remaining men together?
No, no.
I got something so much better now.
Really, what is it?
Well...
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.
And the second rule is
I'm not supposed to talk about it.
And the third rule is...
Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
Look at my face, Bob.
That's fucking... fucking great.
I've never seen you there.
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I go Saturday.
Congratulations.
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?
Yeah, actually...
I hear all kinds of things.
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution
and he sleeps only one hour a night.
He's a great man.
Do you know about Tyler Durden?
I didn't hurt you, did I?
Actually, you did.
Thank you for this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Fight Club.
This was mine and Tyler's gift.
Our gift to the world.
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.
I see all this potential.
And I see it squandered.
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.
Waiting tables.
Slaves with white collars.
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.
We're the middle children of history.
No purpose or place.
We have no Great War.
No Great Depression.
Our great war is a spiritual war.
Our great depression is our lives.
We've all been raised
on television to believe
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.
But we won't.
We're slowly learning that fact.
And we're very, very pissed off.
Yeah!
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...
Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah.
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
Tyler Durden.
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
He don't own this place. I do.
How much money's he getting for this?
There is no money.
Free to all.
Ain't that something?
It is, actually.
Look, stupid fuck!
I want everybody out of here right now.
Hey!
You should join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?
You and your friend.
You hear me now?
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
Still not getting it.
OK, OK, I got it.
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
Back! All of you!
Everybody back!
Ah, Lou!
Come on, man!
We really like this place.
That's right, Lou. Get it out.
Shut the fuck up.
Oh, yeah!
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.
Unbelievable.
You don't know where I've been, Lou.
Oh, my God!
You don't know where I've been!
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
Fucking use the basement! Christ!
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!
On my mother's eyes.
Thanks, Lou.
You too, big guy.
We'll see you next week.
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.
You're gonna start a fight
and you're gonna lose.
Excellent choice, sir.
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.
Son of a bitch!
Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.
Excuse me!
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...
Jay! Go call 911!
Put the hose down.
Stop it! Stop it!
Sorry.
We need to talk.
Where to begin?
With your constant absenteeism?
With your unpresentable appearance?
You're up for review.
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
Let's pretend.
You're the Department of Transportation,
Someone informs you that this company
installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.
What then?
Are you threatening me?
No...
Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!
I have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.
In exchange for my salary,
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?
Security!
I am Jack's smirking revenge.
What the hell are you doing?
That hurt.
Why would you do that?
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
What are you doing?
Oh, God, no! Please! No!
For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.
No!
Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,
something horrible had been growing.
Look.
Give me the paychecks, like I asked,
and you won't ever see me again.
Then, at our most excellent
moment together...
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.
Telephone, computer,
fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.
We now had corporate sponsorship.
This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.
Now, the center of Fight Club
became the two men fighting.
The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.
Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel
over the urine content of their soup.
I am Jack's wasted life.
Thank you, sir.
Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
Yeah, I heard.
There's one in Penns Grove too.
Bob even found one up in New Castle.
Did you start that one?
No, I thought you did.
No.
Stop for a second.
Hey, what are we doing?
Turn around.
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
Human sacrifice.
Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
What are you doing?
Meet me in the back.
Don't fuck around!
Meet me in the back.
On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
What are you doing? Come on!
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.
Small, cramped basement apartment?
How did you know?
They give shitty apartments letters.
Raymond! You're going to die.
No!
Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.
Pick up your dental records. Know why?
There'll be nothing left of your face.
Oh, come on!
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?
Were the midterms hard?
I asked you what you studied!
Biology, mostly.
I don't know.
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!
Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
Animals.
Yeah. Animals and stuff.
Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
So you need more schooling.
Too much school.
Would you rather be dead?
No, please...
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?
Please, no.
I'm keeping your license.
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.
If you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,
you will be dead.
Now run on home.
Run, Forrest, run!
I feel ill.
Imagine how he feels.
Come on, this isn't funny!
What the fuck was the point of that?!
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
You had to give it to him.
Come on.
He had a plan.
And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.
No fear. No distractions.
The ability to let that which does not matter
truly slide.
You are not your job.
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.
You're not the car you drive.
You're not the contents of your wallet.
You're not your fucking khakis.
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.
I'll be out of your way in a sec.
You don't have to go.
Whatever.
No, I mean... It's OK.
Are you still going to groups?
Yeah.
Chloe's dead.
Wow, Chloe.
When did that happen?
Do you care?
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.
Yeah, well...
It was the smart move on her part.
Listen...
What are you getting out of all this?
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...
Is this making you happy?
Yeah, well, sometimes.
I don't know. I don't understand.
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?
What do you get out of it?
No... That's not the same thing at all.
It's totally different with us.
What do you mean by us?
I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
Hear what?
All that noise. Hold on.
No, wait!
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.
You're not talking about me, are you?
No.
Playing doctor. What was going on there?
What are you talking about?
Nothing. Nothing.
I don't think so.
What do you want?
Look at me.
No. What?
It's nothing. Don't worry.
My God. Who did this?
A person.
Guy or girl?
What do you care?
What do you care if I ask?
Leave me alone.
You're afraid to say.
I am not. Let me go.
No! Talk to me.
Let go of me!
This conversation
This conversation
is over.
is over.
I just can't win with you, can I?
Hey, this is getting a little old!
What is... What is all this?
What do you think?
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
Hey!
Too young.
Sorry.
What's all that?
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.
Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Applicant?
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,
he may enter and begin training.
Training for what?
You think this is a game?
You're too young to train here, end of story.
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.
Bad news, friend.
It's not gonna happen.
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
It's not the end of the world.
Just... go away.
Go.
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.
Don't you look at me!
You're never getting in this fucking house!
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!
Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.
Got two black shirts?
Yes, sir.
Two pair of black pants?
Yes, sir.
One pair black boots? Black socks?
Yes, sir.
One blackjacket.
Yes, sir.
$300 personal burial money?
Yes, sir.
All right.
You're too old, fat man.
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.
Bob! Bob!
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
Space monkey.
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.
You are too fucking old, fatty!
And you... You're too fucking
blond!
Get out of here, the both of you!
And so it went.
Listen up, maggots.
You are not special.
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.
Tyler built himself an army.
We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.
We are all part of the same compost heap.
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?
To what purpose?
For what greater good?
In Tyler we trusted.
When he was like,
"You are not yourjob",
I was like, "Yeah!"
Hey, what's all this?
Hey!
What's going on?
We're celebrating.
What are we celebrating?
Go on.
Hey.
Let me get that for you.
The same great taste, Pepsi.
Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.
Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?
We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism in the city
somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.
We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene
of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
She's hot.
Back to you in the studio.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Holy shit!
Yeah!
What the fuck did you guys do?
Arson investigators
are on the premises...
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.
The victory in the war against crime
will not come overnight.
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...
I gotta take a piss.
These are the first steps in a long journey.
That is why we have created Project Hope.
Bob.
Project Hope will be ajoint effort
between the police and community leaders.
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.
Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
His balls are ice cold.
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or
these guys are gonna take your balls.
They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.
Look.
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.
Do not fuck with us.
Ball check!
Bob, you're this way.
Let's go.
I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.
Hey!
Yeah!
I felt like putting a bullet in every panda
that wouldn't screw to save its species.
I wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers
and smother those French beaches
I'd never see.
I wanted to breathe smoke.
Where did you go, psycho boy?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Get him to a fucking hospital.
Yeah.
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.
After you, Mr Durden.
After you.
Something on your mind, dear?
No.
Yeah, why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.
Is this about you and me?
Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.
Fuck that. You should have told me.
Hey, Tyler!
Goddamn it, Tyler!
What do you want?!
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?
You decide your level of involvement!
I will! I wanna know certain things first!
The first rule of Project Mayhem...
I wanna know what you're thinking.
Fuck what you know!
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,
and especially about you and me.
What is that supposed to mean?
What are you doing?
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?
Paint a self-portrait.
Build a house.
And you?
I don't know. Nothing.
Get in the right lane.
You have to know!
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?
Come on!
Not good enough.
Stop fucking around! Tyler!
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
I am sick of all your shit!
Quit screwing around. Steer!
Look at you!
Steer!
Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!
Why? Why? What are you talking about?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!
Let go!
All right. Fine.
Fine.
I'd never been in a car accident.
This must have been
what all those people felt like
before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.
Goddamn!
We've just had a near-life experience!
In the world I see,
you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,
laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane
of some abandoned superhighway.
Feel better, champ.
And then...
Tyler?
..Tyler was gone.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...
The house had become a living thing.
Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.
So many people moving, the house moved.
Planet Tyler.
I had to hug the walls.
Trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!
Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.
Hang on a second.
It's under control, sir.
Where's Tyler?
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...
I'm all alone.
My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.
I am Jack's broken heart.
What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.
The second rule is you do not ask questions.
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!
Who are all these people?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
Tyler isn't here.
Tyler went away.
Tyler's gone.
Get some help!
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!
What happened? What happened?
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.
Destroy a piece of corporate art...
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.
We had it all worked out, sir.
It went smooth until...
Police! Freeze!
They shot Bob.
They shot him in the head.
Oh, God!
Those motherfuckers!
You morons.
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?
What did you think was gonna happen?!
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!
Bury him.
Take him to the garden and bury him.
Come on, people, let's go!
Get the fuck off!
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
This is Bob.
Sir, in...
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Now, you listen to me.
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?
Robert Paulsen.
He's a man
and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?
I understand.
In death, a member of Project Mayhem
has a name.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name... is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
Shut up! This is all over with!
Get the fuck out of here.
Tyler?
No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.
I need to see you...
I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.
I didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.
I wish I could help you,
sir.
Every city I went to,
as soon as I set foot off the plane
I knew a Fight Club was close.
Hey! Hey!
Look at my face. I'm a member.
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture,... be able.
You're a moron.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.
Was I asleep? Had I slept?
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?
We've just heard the stories.
What kind of stories?
Nobody knows what he looks like.
He has plastic surgery every three years.
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
Is Mr Durden building an army?
I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.
Everywhere I went,
I felt I'd already been there.
It was like following an invisible man.
The smell of dried blood,
dirty, bare footprints circling each other.
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.
The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.
I was always just one step behind Tyler.
His name is Robert Paulsen...
Welcome back, sir.
How have you been?
Do you know me?
Is this a test, sir?
No. This is not a test.
You were in here last Thursday.
Thursday?
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.
It's tight as a drum, sir.
Who do you think I am?
Are you sure this isn't a test?
No, this is not a test.
You're Mr Durden.
You're the one who gave me this.
Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.
Yeah?
Marla, it's me.
Have we ever done it?
Done what?
Had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?
Is this a trick?
No. I need to know...
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?
We did make love?
Is that what you're calling it?
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?
We just lost cabin pressure.
What did you just say?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name!
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?
I'm coming over!
I'm not there!
You broke your promise.
Jesus, Tyler.
You fucking talked to her about me.
What the fuck is going on?
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.
Why do people think that I'm you?
Answer me!
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?
I think you know.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?
I... I don't know.
You got it.
No.
Do not fuck with us!
Because...
Because we're the same person.
That's right.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.
I don't understand this.
You wanted a way to change your life.
You could not do this on your own.
All the ways you wish you could be,
that's me.
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
Oh, no.
Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
This isn't possible. This is crazy.
People do it every day.
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.
We should do this again sometime.
At times, you imagine you're watching me.
If this is your first time, you have to fight.
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become
Tyler Durden.
You are not yourjob
or how much money you have!
No. You have a house.
Rented in your name.
You have jobs, a life.
You work nights because you can't sleep.
Or you stay up and make soap.
You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.
Oh, my God.
Now you see our dilemma.
She knows too much.
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.
What... What are you saying?
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!
You are insane!
No. You're insane.
We simply do not have time for this crap.
It's called a changeover.
The movie goes on
and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Sir! Are you checking out?
Yeah. Bill me.
Can you initial this list of phone calls?
When were these made?
Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.
Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
Is anybody here?
Déjà vu all over again.
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.
Oh, my God.
Who am I calling?
1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?
Hello?
1888 Franklin Street?
Yes. Can I help you?
Hello?
Yeah, yeah.
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.
Speaking.
OK, listen to me.
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.
It's under control, sir.
Excuse me?
Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!
They were burning their fingertips with lye.
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
A little more faith than that.
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.
You have every right to be...
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.
Why is it free of charge?
Don't ask.
Whatever.
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.
Clean food, please.
In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.
No clam chowder. Thank you.
You got about 30 seconds.
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?
I know it seems there's two sides to me...
Two sides?
You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
I know. But I realized something important.
The nature of our relationship wasn't clear
to me for reasons I won't go into.
I know I haven't treated you well.
Whatever.
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.
You do?
I really do.
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.
Marla, your life is in danger.
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.
Just go camping...
You're an insane person.
No. I've involved you in something terrible.
No. Shut up!
You're not safe.
Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
I know you did.
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.
You're spectacular in bed.
you're intolerable.
You have very serious emotional problems.
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.
I know, and I'm sorry.
You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.
I can't do this any more.
And I won't.
I'm gone.
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
Marla, you don't understand!
Leave me alone!
Marla, I am trying to protect you!
Let go!
I don't ever wanna see you again!
That's fine...
Here, wait right here!
Hold it right there! Shut up!
Take this money and get on this bus.
I promise I won't bother you again.
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.
Why are you doing this?
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!
If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.
Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
Tyler.
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.
Hello. I need you to arrest me.
I am the leader of a terrorist organization
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.
This is a tightly-regimented organization
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.
That's our headquarters.
In the back, buried in the garden,
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
In the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
I believe the plan is to blow up
the headquarters
of these credit card companies
and the TRW building.
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.
You'll create total chaos.
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone
call.
I really admire what you're doing.
You're a brave man to order this.
You're a genius, sir.
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,
we gotta get his balls.
Don't fight.
It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.
It will set an example.
You're making a big mistake!
You said you'd say that.
I'm not Tyler Durden!
You told us you'd say that too.
All right. I am Tyler Durden.
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.
We're aborting this mission now.
You said you would definitely say that.
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!
Is somebody timing this?
Keep your mouth shut.
Some of this information checks out.
Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
Be right there.
Hey, wait!
I got him.
Sir, we have to do this.
Stop fighting!
Where's the rubber band?
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!
Get down on the floor!
The first person
that comes out of this door
gets a lead salad! Understand?
Get away! Stay away!
I ran.
I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.
Then I ran some more.
What the fuck are you doing?
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.
Oh, Christ.
Now what are you doing?
I'm stopping this.
The greatest thing you've ever done.
I can't let this happen.
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?
The buildings are empty.
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.
If you know, I know.
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.
You think?
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
Pull any one but the green one.
I asked you not to do that!
Tyler, get away from the van.
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!
Goddamn it!
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
Cool it, Tyler!
Come on!
Don't go!
Three minutes.
The beginning.
Ground zero.
I think this is about where we came in.
Do you have a speech for the occasion?
I'm sorry?
I still can't think of anything.
Flashback humor.
It's getting exciting now.
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.
One step closer to economic equilibrium.
Why is she here?
Tying up loose ends.
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!
I beg you, please don't do this.
I'm not doing this.
We are doing this. This is what we want.
No.
I don't want this.
Right. Except you is meaningless now.
We have to forget about you.
You're a voice in my head.
You're a voice in mine!
Why can't I get rid of you?
You need me.
No. I don't. I really don't any more.
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.
Take some responsibility.
I do. I am responsible for all of it
and I accept that.
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.
Have I ever let us down?
How far have you come because of me?!
I will bring us through this.
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming
and in the end you will thank me.
Tyler. Tyler.
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.
But this is too much. I don't want this.
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
Fuck you! I won't do it.
This can't be happening.
It's already done, so shut up!
60 seconds till CRI.
No.
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.
The gun's in my hand.
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
Not my head, Tyler.
Our head.
Interesting.
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?
Hey. It's you and me.
Friends?
Tyler,
I want you to really listen to me.
My eyes are open.
What's that smell?
Where is everybody?
Oh, no. What's going on?
Mr Durden!
Oh, my God!
Are you... Are you all right, sir?
Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
You look terrible, sir. What happened?
Nothing, it's no problem.
No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
You look awful. You need assistance.
I'm fine.
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.
Stop it!
Let her go.
Christ Almighty!
You!
Hi, Marla.
Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
You fucker! What kind of sick
fucking game are you playing at?!
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!
Yeah, I know.
What happened?
Don't ask.
You're shot.
Yes, I'm shot.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe he's standing.
One tough motherfucker.
Who did this?
I did, actually.
Find some gauze.
You shot yourself?
All right, go. Get it.
Hey.
I hear you whispering
about not answering me.
Just remember,
when this is all over
it's just you and me.
Carl, if you're humping,
stop, 'cause I'm coming in.
Dude, it's Dupree.
How the hell did Dupree
end up on the wrong island?
Dupree was born
on the wrong island.
Gentlemen, move this out of the
way, please! We're coming through.
Thank you very much.
Right this way, please.
Careful with the boxes.
Ten minutes ago
those were supposed to be out.
Where's Mr. Thompson?
Dad, this is incredible.
We really didn't
need all this.
I know. But I did.
Dupree!
There he is.
Did other people land
on the wrong island?
Guys, I know I'm in the
doghouse, but come on.
These islands, Maui, Cowee,
Lenowi, very easy to get mixed up.
Don't worry, you're here.
Don't worry.
I got my head turned around. I'm sorry.
Come here, you big lug.
All right.
Thank you.
Folks, this is
a bittersweet time for me.
A day that Molly's mother, rest
her soul, and I used to dream about.
On one hand, I'm inheriting
a new son-in-law,
but on the other,
Daddy's losing
his only little girl.
Now, when Molly told me
that she was gonna marry Carl,
I said, "Who?"
And Molly said,
Daddy, he works for you. 
I said, "Honey, I've got
1,200 employees nationwide. "
But then I started to worry.
Maybe he was some young buck
trying to push me aside,
grab the reins of my company.
And then I met Carl,
sitting in cubicle 26.
You know, I like my chances. 
So, ladies and gentlemen,
will you raise your glass
to Molly and Carl, to health
and happiness. He's funny.
Cheers.
Hear! Hear!
One! Two! Three! Carl!
Hey, everybody,
listen up.
Now, wait.
Just wait.
In honor of your
impending nuptials,
I want to perform a feat that I've
used to mark every special occasion
in our lives since
at least high school.
Ladies and gentlemen,
birds and bees,
I present to you
the Flaming Tornado!
Honey, look who's here!
a safety precaution.
Okay. Little room here.
Need to focus.
Barkeep, your finest Kentucky
bourbon, low-grade tequila...
I've got a mai tai.
Don't let him start till I get
back.... lemon slices, a funnel,
and an open flame.
Yeah!
Okay. Funnel.
Tornado! Tornado!
Open flames.
Carl will have the honor.
Will the groom
please light the liquid?
Carl, grab this. Carl,
you got... Where...
What are you doing?
Do the Tornado.
Maybe later.
No!
No.
What are you doing, man?
No, we'll do it later.
Do it now!
Carl has to be here.
Now!
Let Carl come and do it.
Dude.
I'm doing the Tornado, bitch!
Do that Tornado!
Neil! Neil! Neil!
Oh, my God!
Yo, Tornado Man.
This one is for you,
my brother.
Nice one.
Well, I guess this is where
the road ends for you and me.
We had a good run,
though, didn't we?
Hey, Dupree, I'm not dying.
I'm just getting married.
Yeah, I know. Hey, listen.
I feel bad about, you know, earlier
when I was laughing like a hyena
when Mr. Thompson was making
all those jokes at your expense.
Well, they weren't really at my
expense. No, no, no, they were.
It was a shot across
your bow. Yeah? You think?
It wasn't that funny.
I mean, it was,
but I shouldn't have been
laughing, 'cause I'm your best man,
and I don't want this guy
getting in your head, okay?
'Cause he's in my head
a little bit.
It just... It's... I don't
know. I don't want you to forget
that you're bringing something
to the table, too, okay?
You've got that...
That Carlness.
That little
twinkle in your eye.
And you're giving it
to me right now.
That little glint that says
they're never gonna beat you.
They can't lay
a glove on you.
And don't forget that, because
you can't put a price tag on it.
End of sermon.
Well, thanks, buddy,
I appreciate it.
But, you know, I really think
he was kidding around.
Yeah. Guy's got a kind
of a weird sense of humor.
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna be
working for him for the rest of my life.
You know,
I got plans of my own.
There it is.
There's that Carlness.
They can't lay a glove on you, can they?
God, I admire you.
I really do.
That's no secret.
Oh, I wanted to give you this.
You know,
for being my best man.
You got to be shitting me.
It's a flask!
You like it?
I love this.
Good. Hey, you know, that reminds
me of the groomsmen outfits.
I really like them,
but I'm wondering,
should mine be a little
different since I'm the best man?
What did you have in mind?
Just like a little
insignia or a patch.
I don't want
people to be confused.
I'm talking
something understated,
like a lightning bolt.
Nothing big.
Lightning bolt?
Something.
Could be cool.
Yeah. I like it.
Although, it is going to be listed in
the program that you're the best man.
Really?
That's pretty good. Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That should be enough.
Now, is Neil gonna be
okay over there?
I'm seeing him, and it looks
like the tide's coming up.
Neil's gonna be fine.
Bingo!
Oh, wow! How many thank-you notes
do you think we have to write?
Well, I counted 111.
Honey, I'm gonna do
half of them.
Oh, come on. Really?
No, no, no. Really.
Dear whoever gave us
this platter, I love it!
Finally a platter. Just what I always
wanted ever since I was a little boy.
And now you've made
my platter dreams come true.
That's perfect. And then you
write 55 more just like that,
and you're done.
Yeah.
And this is Molly.
Molly.
We can't get to the phone right
now. You've reached the Petersons.
So, if you leave a
message... Wait for the beep.
...we'll get back to you as
soon as we can. All right...
Have a beautiful day.
All right, let's do it again.
No. That was really cute.
I called you Carl. It was really
funny. Molly, it was cheesy.
No, it wasn't cheesy.
Give it to me.
It's totally cheesy.
Give me the machine.
No! It's good cheesy!
Give me the machine.
No!
ID? Hey, married guy, how you doing?
Good morning, Reese.
Top of the morning, Paco.
So, we're back
from the honeymoon.
Oh, yeah, we...
We had a great time, sir.
It was just...
It was really wonderful.
So I took a look at your
proposal while you were gone.
The Oaks at Mesa Vista.
You like it?
Did I like it?
I loved it!
It's perfect for lot 208.
208? It's huge.
If I may, Mr. Thompson, it...
Mesa Vista is really more of a
smaller, 40-unit eco-community.
Not anymore, Carl. You got to
think big, you got to think bold.
You're a married man now.
You're married to my little girl.
I'm fast-tracking this
project. And you, sir,
you're the lead designer
on it.
Excuse me, sir?
That's right.
You are the lead designer.
Wow, that's... Wow,
that's... That's great.
What happened to Harrison?
I had to let him go
while you were gone.
I had a little problem
with Rancho del Mar.
But, Carl,
I believe in you.
You've got it.
It's here and it's here.
Release it.
Okay. I'll do that, sir.
Release it.
Wow! I can't believe it.
He made you lead designer.
Yeah. Apparently,
he just loved my proposal.
And it's a little bit bigger
than I initially planned,
but you know, hey,
maybe that's a good thing.
So, what does this mean?
Well, it means
I've got my own office.
Which is really great:
Oh, and it's got a view:
A view of trees and some cars.
It's just terrific, and...
Living the dream, honey.
Living the dream.
Maybe we can celebrate
a little when you get
home tonight from guys' night.
Are you trying to seduce me?
I'll see you tonight:
Carl, you made it!
Intense matches going on.
Hey, there he is!
Can you feel the fun
for the guys' night?
I can just feel it,
you know?
Shit balls!
It's my alarm. My hour's up.
That's it for me.
What, are you kidding me?
Bullshit.
Where are you going?
I've got to go
meet my wife
and watch Sisterhood of
the Traveling Ya-Ya Pants:
I don't... How late do you get to
stay out? I used to have midnight.
Do you get midnight?
'Cause I was late once, and...
I'm a grown man, Neil.
I don't have a curfew.
Not yet you don't.
But in all seriousness, you
got to tell me something, okay?
Do I smell like beer?
Yeah.
Good. Because you know what
I don't smell like, then?
Cigarettes and weed.
That one's free.
Yeah!
The dream continues!
Still undefeated!
Yes! Nice.
Will you look at this guy?
Look at you.
Is this what it looks like
to be married?
Come here, man.
It's still early on.
To fidelity, commitment,
the whole shebang.
Yeah, and I also
got a promotion today.
Add it to the list. Forever
blessed as the dream continues.
How are you doing, buddy?
How am I doing?
Good question.
Turns out I got fired for taking
that week off to go to the wedding.
Wait a minute.
You got fired?
Apparently,
I never had authorization.
My boss claims
he never received my e-mail.
Then I had a little bit
of a cash flow situation,
so I ended up
losing my apartment.
You're not living
out of your car?
Carl, I'm not an animal.
Plus, it was a company car.
So when I lost the job...
It's okay.
I picked up a ten-speed.
Dave's letting me crash
at the bar after hours.
Dupree, you can't sleep in a
bar. We're not in our 20s anymore.
Sure you can. I got
a cot set up in the back.
This is ridiculous.
Look, you're gonna come home
and you're going to stay with us.
That's sweet of you to say,
but I can't impose, and I won't.
Dupree will land
on his feet as always.
Can I have a toast, please?
Thank you.
Listen, Dupree, we've
got to get rid of the cot.
Some of the regulars
are starting to complain.
They don't think it's fair that you
get to sleep here and they don't.
Curley said that, didn't he?
Curley? Curley!
What? You got a problem
with me sleeping on the cot?
We all have a problem
with you sleeping on the cot.
We took a vote.
The ayes have it.
Dupree? Live with us?
Not live.
Just stay for a couple of days
until he gets back
on his feet.
Molly, he's been
sleeping in a bar.
How does that happen?
Who knows? It's Dupree.
I mean, I told you. His mother moved
to Florida with that yoga idiot,
and all of his friends are
married, including myself.
He's got nowhere to go.
He's like an orphan.
Wait a second.
What's all this?
This is that celebration
we were supposed to have
about your promotion.
Oh, that's right.
I'm sorry, hon.
Look, Molly,
let me go outside
and tell Dupree
to bring his bags in...
What? Dupree's here?
Carl! Carl.
Carl.
Okay, look, you're right.
I screwed up. I did this
all wrong, and I'm sorry.
I should have called first.
You know what? Maybe I should just
give him some money for a motel.
Carl. Carl.
He's your best friend.
He's here.
He can stay.
That's great, Molly.
Look, it's only gonna
be for a couple days.
Well, a week at the most.
After that,
he's out of here.
Keep those candles burning.
I'll be right back.
Hey, Molly.
I want you to know I really,
really appreciate this, okay?
Yeah. No. It's really no
problem, Dupree. Thanks.
Nice moose.
Oh, yeah.
Murphy,
say hello to the missus.
Hi, Murphy.
Come on in, buddy. Make
yourself at home. Great.
I hope the couch
is okay 'cause
we're working on everything
upstairs. Oh, yeah. I'm fine anyplace.
And you know where
everything is. Thank you.
Great.
Thank you. And, hey, listen,
just to put your minds at ease,
this is not a permanent
situation. Okay?
I'm hitting the job trail,
I'm gonna hit it hard tomorrow.
Wheels of change
are in motion.
Good. Good.
That's a good attitude.
Despite what my ex-boss said,
I'm not unhirable.
Those copiers didn't exactly
sell themselves.
And frankly, I think
we had an inferior product,
and I'd tell people that
if they asked.
I wasn't going to lie
for that son of...
I don't want to get
started on him, but...
Okay, great.
Well, make yourself at home,
and Molly and I are...
Well, we're going to go upstairs
and take care of some stuff.
Well, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen, we're all adults here.
You're newlyweds. Making
love's a big part of that.
You're supposed to explore
each other. I get it.
Come on.
If this situation's
gonna work,
we've got to be honest
with each other.
Now, go on. Enjoy yourselves.
I'm not gonna listen.
Hump away. Go on, get
out of here. Good night.
Good night.
I'm kind of dreading
the talk with his parents.
He hasn't really been treating
anybody very nicely at...
That's not good.
No. Not for us
or our couch.
Computer skills. Not really.
The Oaks at Mesa Vista.
This is exciting, isn't it?
You know, sir, if we're
not gonna have any trees,
maybe we should consider
changing the name.
No. No, no,
I love the name.
Names are important, Carl.
Are you gonna
answer that phone?
Give me a second.
What do you want?
Real quick, where
do you keep the plungers?
A plunger? What do you need
a plunger for?
No reason. Just want
to stay on top of stuff.
What do you mean "no reason"?
What happened?
No reason. I just want to know where
things are in case there's an emergency,
which there probably
never will be.
I don't have time for this.
I don't have time for this.
I'm at work. I got to go.
You better
make some time for it
'cause we got
a little bit of a situation.
I didn't want to have to
Carl?
Just stopped.
Where were we?
We were talking about names,
Carl. How important they are.
Would you ever consider letting
Molly keep her last name?
I mean, I know it's a strange
request coming from a father-in-law,
but a man's name
is his legacy,
and if Molly takes yours,
then the Thompson name
dies with me.
Well, there's lots of
Thompsons around, aren't there?
Not in a direct line, Carl.
No, no, not in a direct line.
Well, what about our kids?
Children should have the last name
of the father, don't you think?
You're having kids?
Well, not right now,
but eventually.
You know, in certain
Asian cultures, Carl,
the husband
takes the wife's name.
Wait a minute. You just said
a man's legacy is his name.
All right.
What about a hyphen?
A hyphen?
Yeah.
I could ask Molly,
but I don't think she...
Wait a minute. You mean me.
You mean
I'm supposed to hyphenate.
Well, then you can still use your own name,
only you'll be hyphenating it. It's win-win.
With all due respect,
not for me it isn't, sir.
All right, forget it. You're
obviously upset about it.
You know what, I'm sorry
I even brought it up.
Let's keep focused
on your project.
Come on! Come on! Toshi, what are
you doing? You gave him a meatball!
Watch the car!
Throw it, throw it.
We got him.
Throw it, throw it!
Did he touch the plate? He...
Oh, here we go.
The game just turned. Yes!
Carl Peterson,
third team honorable mention.
All-district, 1984.
We get Carl.
No, we get him.
Hey, what's going on?
There he is.
Hey, sweet heat.
Time to dust off
the old jockstrap.
This kid Dougie's been
killing us all afternoon.
We need your arm out there.
Let's go.
Dupree, I'd love to, but I
can't. I kind of had a rough day.
And I better go in
and see Molly.
I like it.
Family first. Priorities.
Okay, he can't play. We're
gonna have to do it ourselves.
Now listen, I want you to brush him
back here, okay? What's a brushback?
It's where you throw it really
close to him. Scare him a little bit,
but don't hit him 'cause
he's bigger than you.
But, Mr. Dupree,
I don't even play baseball.
I'm in the orchestra,
remember?
First of all, call me Dupree
'cause I'm your team-mate.
Second of all, so what
if you're in the orchestra.
So was Catfish Hunter.
Let's go. Let's go. Here we go!
Here we go! Hey, batter, batter...
Hi! How was work?
It was fine.
Good fine? Bad fine?
Fine, fine.
You wouldn't believe the response
I'm getting for my Career Day program.
And I saved a spot for you on
the 15th if you're interested.
Yeah, of course.
I'll bring in some blueprints
and maybe even some models.
It'll be fun.
TOSHl: No. Get away.
You hit me! You hit me on purpose!
The kids'll really love it.
No more fighting.
Thank you, that's it!
Hey! Hey! Come on now!
Break it up. That's it!
you've reached Dupree:
If this is in regards
to employment,
please be aware that my Class
Four driver's license has expired,
and I am no longer willing to
work with asbestos: I won't do it:
Can you believe that?
A little chin music
and the whole neighborhood
goes crazy.
It was like... Oh, and for
Carl and Molly, press two:
Oh, I meant
to tell you about that.
I changed the answering machine
in case somebody calls about a job.
I'm staying on top
of this job thing.
You guys are okay with that,
right?
We got to put the job first.
Well, Carl,
are we okay with that?
Molly. Molly, come on.
Nice.
Simply the best:
When did we get HBO?
Yeah, you saw that.
I upgraded us, and I'm
going to go halfsies on it
'cause I love it also.
You get it upstairs,
too.
I think you get
the Oxygen channel, too.
What? What are you doing?
What do you want? Cinemax?
What do you hear?
What do you say?
So, let me get this straight. I mean,
he hijacks our answering machine.
Carl and Molly, press two. 
And then he decides, "Hey,
I'm sleeping on the couch,
and I'm gonna order HBO.
I mean, I don't know, Carl.
Am I wrong here?
Carl!
Molly, what do you want
me to do, whack the guy?
Look, I told Dupree not to
change anything without asking,
and I gave him
a pair of pajamas.
Dupree's gonna
get the hang of this.
He's never truly been domesticated.
He's like the ape-man of Borneo.
Oh, so we're the lucky ones
who get to housebreak him?
No, you know what I mean,
honey.
I'm over it.
I finished
my thank-you notes today.
Do you need help with
your half? No, no, no, I...
Candlesticks, bread maker,
Crock-Pot. I got them covered.
It's my final offer.
No, I got them covered.
Sorry to interrupt. Oh!
Damn it, Dupree! What is
this? This is an emergency.
I'm sorry. The downstairs
crapper, it's on the fritz again.
What do you mean,
"It's on the fritz"?
I don't know.
It's on the fritz.
Please tell me he's joking.
We might need some matches.
Does that
answer your question?
Oh, God!
Dupree! Oh, my God. I don't...
Carl! Carl!
Dupree! Dupree?
Yo!
Dupree, what you did in our
bathroom last night was disgusting.
Molly nearly passed out.
I know, I know.
Believe me. I'm never
eating Buffalo wings again.
I don't care how much
I love them. I'm off them.
It's weird. I used to have a stomach
like a billy goat, but not anymore.
Now, I made a little breakfast
for... Molly, great.
Come here.
Morning.
Good morning.
Right here. Let me get
this chair for you here.
Have a seat. Breakfast is served. Yes.
I believe Carl told me
you're a fan of
the banana pancake
and the soy macchiato.
One second.
I want
this to be perfect.
Did you tell him all this?
Here you go.
Soy macchiato.
Dupree, you really didn't have to do
all this. Yes, I did have to do this.
Look, I know I got off
on the wrong foot,
and I just want you both to know
that I really appreciate this.
And I'm grateful.
I don't know what to say,
but... Don't say anything.
Just accept my apology
and enjoy this feast.
I'm off to a very promising
job interview
which explains my natty
attire. Wish me luck. Goodbye.
Good luck. Go get them,
tiger! I will. Thank you.
Off like a prom dress.
So, why don't you
describe yourself, Mr. Dupree.
I'm a people person.
Very personable.
I absolutely insist
on enjoying life.
Not so task-oriented.
I'm not a workhorse.
If you're looking for a Clydesdale,
I'm probably not your man.
Like, I don't live to work.
It's more the other way
around. I work to live.
Incidentally, what's
your policy on Columbus Day?
Yeah, we work.
Really?
The guy discovered
the New World.
I'm afraid to even ask
about Victory over Japan Day.
You have a call waiting
on line:::
Hey, we tried. Right?
Thanks a lot. Yeah.
I'm gonna keep my résumé.
Excuse me.
You've got to lean into it
and commit to it.
That's the way.
You get hurt if you're afraid.
And if you time it
just right, then you both...
There he goes. Come down. You
guys got to get a rhythm going.
Come on.
Here, watch me. See, I'm just
running down the ramp.
It's actually harder
than on a skateboard.
There we go.
Speed's your friend. Hold on.
Yeah, come down. Go.
You see how he's timing it?
And then he pops it up? Go!
Yes! Go! One more time.
So,
what's going on over here?
Carl, check out this badass skate
ramp I had Aaron's dad build for us.
Hey, man, I was just telling these guys
how we used to tear it up back in the day.
Yep! Pretty good.
Hey, I got an idea.
What do you say we put on
a little show for these guys?
Throw down some one-wheelers.
Make it rain out here.
Come on. For a second.
Yeah,
let's see what you got.
Yeah,
show us something.
Okay, give me a board.
Yes! Carl!
Step aside, guys.
Honey, I need some help.
Yep,
just like back in the day.
Nice!
Let's show them
how we used to do it.
Step aside.
Step aside.
Well, no one ever said
we were gonna live forever.
Let's go.
Carl! Carl,
what are you doing?
What's it look like he's doing?
He's getting ready to rip it up.
Relax, Molly. This is
only gonna take a second.
Come on, Dupree!
Say when.
When!
Yeah!
Oh, I'm racked!
Carl!
Oh, I racked
my little Duprees.
When was the last time
you were even on a skateboard?
For a second there
we almost had it back.
Yeah.
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
Is this some kind of a joke?
Carl,
Thompson wanted more units.
Thought it would work better
as a wraparound.
Wraparound.
Mesa Vista
is not a wraparound.
Hasta mañana, Paco.
Good night, boss.
Look, Mr. Thompson. Hey.
You see the preliminaries?
Yeah, I did, and it's completely
different than my original proposal.
God damn it, Carl.
Will you stop fighting this?
People buy homes. Let the
government pay for the parks.
That's why we have taxes.
The Oaks at Mesa Vista
is a money train.
You wanna be on it?
Yeah, I'm on it.
Money train.
I'll give you a money train.
Right there! Right there!
You gotta throw it now!
Please, please, please!
No, he didn't go over!
No! No! Why?
He didn't make it, man.
Carl! Welcome home!
Come here, buddy!
We got one for you.
Get a beer for him.
What are you guys doing?
We're watching the game.
Yeah, I can see that.
Hey, guys! Please, shut
the hell up for two seconds
'cause it's fourth and
inches. Please, just shut up.
You shut up!
It's fourth and inches!
Why don't you watch it
in your house?
I can't have friends over on
weeknights and you know that.
Grow a sac.
It's not my problem, Neil.
Take it up with Annie.
Time for the lion tamer. Yeah,
well, I can't talk to him like this.
What's going on?
You all right?
Yeah. I'm fine.
God, I've been
watching you lately, man,
and you're really putting in the
hours, but you got to find some balance.
Find a little Carl time. You
know what I'm saying? Carl time.
First down, Cougars:
Now Washington State:::
You're right.
Carl time.
Come here.
Molly's got the Back
to School thing tonight.
We got the house to ourselves
for a while. Let's watch the game.
Let your hair down. Let
your hair down. I mean...
You think I've been overdoing
it with the work thing?
I know you've been
overdoing it.
Yeah. Shake it loose, huh? Just live
a little, man. Just live a little.
Yeah. You know, maybe I
ought to make my nachos.
Nice!
Yes!
Carl time! Nachos, Carl
nachos are in my belly.
Hey, Neil, turn up the
volume. Okay. Yeah, yeah.
You know who else loves
Carl's nachos is Eddie.
Give him a call.
I already did.
Carl, soup them up, man!
Make them spicy!
Come on. Just come on.
Please. Please, God!
Send everybody!
Send everybody!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
No, no.
No, no.
No!
No, no!
No! No!
No!
Yes!
What did I tell you?
That's what I'm saying!
Congratulations, idiots.
Congratulations, guys. Very good.
Fifty pushups, faggot.
I'm not giving you
That was the deal.
Fine. Okay? Enjoy it.
One, two...
He has a condition.
...three, four. That's
right! I have a condition.
I should not keep doing this.
Come on!
I have a gamey colon, and
it gets spastic and spasms.
You don't have a condition.
Carl. Carl! Neil, shut up!
Carl. I didn't read that.
Mark, what? What is it, Mark?
Molly.
Oh, hey, Molly.
You're home early.
Really?
I just invited
some of the guys over
to watch a little football.
Figured it was just a little time
to loosen up. A little Carl time.
Me gusta margarita!
Hola, Dupree.
Hola, Molly.
Charlie.
Brilliant.
Sorry.
We should go.
You guys want to go?
Yeah, let's get out of here.
That's a good idea.
Let's go to Larry's.
Let's get out of here.
Let it go. Let it go.
What'd I do with my tie? Let's go.
Bye.
Sorry, I ashed on your floor.
Great.
Take that tie off your head.
I'll bring this back tomorrow.
I'll give it to Carl at the office.
So, don't tell Annie I was
here. And if you do, don't...
Just don't tell her that I asked
you not to... Get out, Neil.
Okay. I'll just go.
I know what you're thinking,
Molly.
But we were gonna have this
rug shampooed. I promise you.
Oh, and look. Look at that.
It's my grandmother's
silver cheese platter.
You used it to serve nachos.
Well,
nachos have cheese in them.
Let me just start cleaning up
some of... Dupree, please stop.
Somebody arriving late for the
party. Don't worry about it.
The party... Game's over!
Go away! The party's over!
Party... Molly,
for the love of God! Please!
We heard there were
some bad boys in here.
There were, but they left.
You know, Carl, I...
I really think I've been pretty
cool about this whole situation,
and I hate having
this conversation with you.
But this is not exactly how
I pictured us getting started.
I know.
Look, Dupree's got to go.
No. It's not about
kicking Dupree out.
It's just that you said it
was gonna be a couple of days.
Look, Molly.
He's my best friend.
Somehow I feel
responsible for him.
Then maybe it's time to start
prioritizing your responsibilities.
You're right.
What if he had a girlfriend? Good idea.
But how is a guy with no job, no
car, living on somebody's couch
gonna find any kind of
girlfriend? Our new librarian.
She seems really nice.
You want to fix Dupree up
with a really nice librarian?
Listen, I know the guy
for 25 years.
I think he's more into the young,
foreign, non-librarian type.
Well, it wouldn't hurt to ask.
I wouldn't get my hopes up.
I'll do it.
Oh, that's great. Do you want
to know anything about her?
No. Well, does she have a car?
Yeah. She does.
Good. See if she can swing by and
get me around 8:00. Or quarter to.
Tonight?
Please.
Mandy. That's even better.
Librarian.
No. No.
I thought you were
really brave.
I mean, I have a whole new
respect for you, Carl.
Well, the rice was okay,
but just for the record,
octopus does not
taste like chicken.
But you ate it.
Funky Cold Medina?
It looks like Dupree
brought his date home.
Honey, what is a tie
doing on our door?
Molly, I think we ought to drive
around the block a couple times.
Wait a minute. No way.
Mandy's a Mormon.
She's not the kind of girl...
A Mormon?
...who would get busy
on the first date.
You fixed Dupree up
with a Mormon librarian.
Molly, wait!
Oh, my God.
Let's drive
around the block.
Carl!
That butter dish
was our wedding gift.
Guys, guys! Hold it! Let me explain.
What was he doing with butter?
Dupree, no need to explain.
It's not what it looks like.
Dupree, no explanation
necessary. I know.
Go back in the house!
Not before I thank Molly
for the best night of my life.
Mol, Mol. Thank you.
What happened in there, it
was so natural. So beautiful.
Go back inside. Listen, I've
got neighbors. I know you do.
But listen to me.
I'm in love.
Dupree. Dupree, I'm not going
to do this with you tonight!
Jesus! Molly, call the
fire department! Oh, my...
Carl!
Fire in our house!
It's fire!
My couch!
Roll!
God, I loved this couch.
You know, when I saw you
on fire, my heart stopped.
I had so much adrenaline pumping
through me, I probably could have...
Could have picked up this car
and just hurled it 10 blocks.
Are you gonna do this,
or am I gonna have to?
I'll take care of it.
Tonight, Carl.
Go on, get out of here.
Or I'm not responsible for what
these hands are gonna do. Go!
Bye.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, just a little
smoke inhalation.
Wow. Unbelievable.
Mandy was
completely unharmed.
Fire chief said that the
butter probably saved her life.
You talk about a miracle. You
just got to thank the big man.
It's all you can...
What is wrong with you? Why did
you have to use so many candles?
I was just trying
to set a mood.
You know how I am, Carl.
Yeah. I do.
Look...
It's about time
you got on the road.
You guys need any help?
No, we're good. Relax.
Well,
I had a lovely stay.
Thank you both
for your generosity.
Sorry about last night,
and no hard feelings.
I hope. At least,
there are none on my part.
Okay. Are you sure you got a place
to go? Yeah. I got a place to go.
Going to Mandy's.
The librarian?
Don't you think that's kind of
moving a little quickly, Dupree?
Maybe it is, but so what?
Something special is happening
there. I'm not gonna fight it.
Hey, take care of this
big mook for me.
Bye. See you guys.
Tosh, listen.
You got the heart
of a damn lion.
I respect you. You took a beating,
but you took it like a man.
God bless all of you.
Goodbye!
Off to Mandy's!
Oh, my God! Carl.
Okay! Sir, are you sure you're okay?
My helmet saved me.
You see that?
He's gonna be fine.
Here's your bag.
Thank you.
Bye!
Bye.
Carl.
Carl?
We've been staring at this for over
two hours. Let's go get some dinner.
Or margaritas.
Celebrate our emancipation.
The insurance adjuster
recommended that we sue Dupree.
For a moose head?
Just curious.
It was the margarita
that did it, wasn't it?
It was the emancipation
I like this song.
Smooth ta-ta-ria
She makes a smooth margarita
We had some good margaritas
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?
What the hell is he doing?
I thought
he was going to Mandy's.
Honey, I don't think
he can see us.
Maybe we should
just keep going.
It's pouring rain outside.
Not that bad.
Honey, look at him.
Molly. Molly!
Dupree!
Dupree.
Dupree, what are you doing?
It's pouring rain outside.
I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.
Yeah, well, what about Mandy? Don't ask.
Carl, can you get his bike?
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go home.
Carl, honey, bike.
Carl!
I'm coming!
I really appreciate this,
Trust me, no more open flames.
I've learned my lesson.
All right, well,
it's been a long night.
So, I'm gonna go to bed.
Dupree, try not to go to sleep
with that head wet. Okay?
Good night, Molly.
Dupree. I don't mean
to come down on you,
but you need to start
getting your life together.
We're grown-ups now.
Yeah.
You know what I mean? I
know. I know. You're right.
And if you're going to stay here, things
are gonna be different from now on.
No more naked stuff.
Well, it felt natural to
be naked. I... I don't care!
I do not care.
Clean up after yourself,
watch the noise,
try to help out
around the house, please?
It's not too much to ask.
You're right.
Carl? I can be really helpful
when I set my mind to it.
And that's what I'm gonna do.
Another thing.
Would you mind writing
some thank-you notes for me?
Yeah. That'd be great.
Try to get some sleep.
Gut-check time, Dupree.
"Dear Aunt Kathy.
"Thank you so much
for the wine glasses. "
And this, of course,
is the point of the race
where speed will play
a major factor,
where long months of training
certainly pay off:
Hello?
Yeah, Dupree. I'm gonna
need you to do me a solid.
Yeah, no problem.
What do you got?
I promised Molly I would give this
Career Day presentation today at 1:00.
But her father just dropped
a big one on me,
so I'm gonna need you
to step in and fill in for me.
Can you do that?
I don't know, Carl.
I don't know the first thing
about the development business.
I really think Mr. Thompson
might find me in over my head.
No, not the development
business. School, Dupree.
to fill in for me
at Molly's school:
No, no, no. Not this time.
What? No, no, I'm talking
to Lance Armstrong.
He's trying to break away from
the pack. I got him, though.
Will you quit dicking around with your
little Huffy bike and listen to me?
Hey, Molly.
Dupree, what are you doing?
Carl asked me to fill in.
I guess there was
some sort of work conflict.
What? Conflict?
What kind of conflict?
I don't know.
I don't ask questions.
I just ride
to where I'm needed.
But don't worry. I'm sort
of a good public speaker.
Oh, no, no. It's a Career Day presentation,
Dupree. You don't even have a job.
I understand that. But here's
what I'd love you to do.
Please get Mandy here.
I want her to see this.
I think this will
win her back.
Now where are these
little rug rats?
They're in the third door.
Hey, how are you?
First of all, thank you for
giving me the opportunity
to come talk to you
on Career Day.
Now, I am not
Mr. Carl Peterson
and I don't have
a career per se.
I guess you could say my
career is living and loving.
And I do that to the utmost.
She coming?
Keep going? Okay.
I see all you
fresh-faced kidlets,
sitting there in your neat little
rows, and you're all just pods.
Pods, waiting
for your instructions.
Now some of you are
gonna get zapped right away
and be 15-year-old prodigies,
little midget Olympic gymnasts
with their pictures on cereal boxes.
Some of you will go on to college,
and you'll find your rhythm there,
and then go chase down
the titans of industry,
or maybe straighten out
our problems at the UN.
But some of you,
and this is the group that no one ever
comes into Career Day and addresses,
and it's criminal,
some of you are
just gonna float along,
eating spicy foods,
humming black people's music
into your 30s.
Well into your 30s,
languishing.
This group of pods is gonna
do a lot of languishing.
And you're gonna
take some heat for it.
Sadly, you will.
Europe's a little easier. They
seem to understand a little better.
So does South America.
I went to Argentina one time,
and everyone just seemed to be
sitting around. It was beautiful.
But that's okay.
You stay loose. Stay liquid.
Laugh a lot. But be ready.
That's what Dupree's doing
with his life's little pod.
Staying nimble. Till I get
the call from the mother ship.
My raison d'état:
Then I'd fight.
Then you'll see Dupree coming in here
throwing seven different kinds of smoke.
That's fine. The pods that
were supposed to hear this did.
It'll kick in when it
needs to. I'm done here.
I told you. Now, do you
think it went over their head?
No. It was really good.
They got it. They got it.
Now, where's Mandy? I'm only
gonna do this one more time,
but we got to get her here!
Dupree, Mandy has to...
She had a...
She had a book
that was lost.
I'm sorry, Dupree.
Dupree, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Dupree, there's something
you need to know about Mandy.
Well, it turns out that she's a total slut
and is sleeping with half the male faculty.
What? No.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Sorry, Dupree.
I would have never set you up
with her
if I would have known.
Ever. Okay, kids, back inside.
Let's go.
Ever.
Great job today,
kids. Yeah. Good teamwork.
You did good,
Billy. All right, let's go.
Yeah. All right, let's get
ready for the next class.
Afraid so.
He's not even on the faculty.
There really aren't any more Audrey
Hepburns out there, are there?
Oh, what a sucker.
Dupree? Dupree?
You talk to Sam
about the zoning issues?
Yeah. And to be honest with
you, sir, they're still in flux.
Carl, I'm going to the bank in days,
all right? I cannot have things in flux.
I realize that, sir.
I'll get on it right away.
Carl, sit down, please.
Please just sit down.
You know, there's
something you said to me
a few days ago that I just
cannot get out of my mind.
Something about you and
Molly having children.
Oh, right. Yeah, no. That
was... That was hypothetical.
That's not something that we're
talking about doing any time soon.
You know what I did, Carl,
when I started dating again?
No idea.
I got a vasectomy.
A vasectomy?
Yeah.
Okay. That's a little
extreme, don't you think?
Not really. It's a mild
outpatient procedure.
A little local anesthesia,
sit on a bag of frozen peas
for a night. Voilà.
I mean, that was it,
one hundred percent effective.
Yeah.
Carl, read the literature.
It is reversible.
Seventy percent of the time. All right.
See you get your shit together, all right?
I want it back on my desk, this
zoning stuff, by 3:00 today.
All right?
Thank you, Carl.
All right?
Fine: How are you?
Fine. How are you?
Oh, fine:
you were great back there:
You weren't so bad yourself:
we'd better get Irving's car
and get out of here:
So you really were serious
about Audrey Hepburn, huh?
She had it all. Style,
grace, ethereal beauty.
Just like I thought Mandy did.
I don't know. I have a hard
time imagining Audrey Hepburn
getting buttered up
to Funky Cold Medina:
Really? I don't.
The Mouth of Truth: The legend
is that if you're given to lying
and you put your hand in
there, it will be bitten off:
I'm still trying to understand
why Carl didn't show up today.
I know he's under a lot
of pressure right now,
but just lately he seems
like a different person.
No, he's just working really
hard. He gets like that sometimes.
Maybe if he opened up
a little bit more.
Look, Carl's never gonna be
mistaken for the great communicator.
I mean, just mention the word
feelings" or "emotion,
and you watch his eyes
glaze over. But...
I don't know.
He just puts up a wall.
Well, how do you get past it?
I think you just fight
through it. Patience.
That's what I did.
I ask a lot of questions.
I let him know that I care.
And I just pray he drops his
guard, 'cause when he does,
it's so worth it.
Hello:
You beast!
It was perfectly awful!
That gets me every time,
and I know it's coming.
So, Dupree did a good job?
Did he mention
the mother ship?
Actually, in a weird way,
he was really inspiring.
I didn't know he was so sensitive.
Did you know he writes poetry?
Poetry?
Yeah.
Man, what a homo.
Wow.
That is really mature, Carl.
Look, honey, I'm sorry
I didn't make it today.
What is going on with you
lately? Oh, nothing. I'm fine.
You are clearly
not fine, Carl.
So why don't you meet me
halfway here, please.
All right. You want to
know what's going on?
I'll tell you
what's going on.
I think your father hates me.
Carl. Carl, my father
does not hate you.
He gives you
this big promotion,
which you said
was a dream come true.
Why would he do that?
Because he hates you?
That's exactly
what I'm beginning to think.
For the same reason
he's been systematically
trying to emasculate me
and sterilize me.
Slow down. 'Cause now you're
not making any sense.
I'm not making any sense?
Well, here's something that
should make perfect sense to you.
Now, everybody knows that your
father, when he likes somebody,
he invites them out
on a little fishing trip.
Fact. I've never been
invited fishing. Not once.
You hate fishing.
He doesn't know that.
I'm telling you, Molly,
he hates me.
Look, Carl, I know how my
father gets sometimes. I do.
He pushes people
when he wants results.
And it's frustrating,
I know.
But he doesn't hate you.
And I know you want to do
a great job on this project,
but it's taking over
your life.
And we're supposed
to be having fun.
Why don't you come home at
a decent hour tomorrow night?
Dupree wants to cook for us.
We'll sit down,
we'll have dinner, relax.
Talk about things
other than work.
And everything
will be okay.
Yeah.
You'll see.
Fine.
Fine.
Yeah.
Hey.
You busy?
No.
on some back issues.
What's going on?
I wanted to ask you something.
Yeah?
Would you be offended if Thompson
asked you to get a vasectomy?
What? Why would he want me
to get a vasectomy?
Carl, I barely know the man!
Wait a minute! Wait! Dupree.
Yes, I'd be offended!
No. Not you.
That's not what I mean. Just
what do you think of vasectomies?
Cutting off my manhood?
I think it's barbaric.
No one's getting near that
part of my body. No one, Carl.
Unless, of course,
it's a woman.
And then she better
not have a scalpel.
Of course.
Why would he want me
to get a vasectomy?
He doesn't want you
to get a vasectomy.
It was a hypothetical question. Okay.
Just forget I asked.
Don't joke with me
like that, man.
Go back to your reading.
Watch that heat.
Slow stirring, Molly.
How are my game hens doing?
Wow.
Gorgeous.
Okay, get started on the
salad. Put some walnuts in.
I'll take care of this. Okay.
How'd you learn all this?
Most of it I picked up in a six-week
series, Treasures of Tuscany:
The garlic technique, however,
I got from watching Goodfellas:
I actually make
an incredible risotto,
but I want to keep it
low carb tonight for Carl.
Poor guy has kind of let the
wheels come off a little bit. Okay.
Twenty minutes
till the big guy gets here.
Focus. We got to
come together now.
Merlot. I want you to get
it out. Get it breathing.
We're gonna use the 2005, Napa
wine glasses Aunt Kathy gave us.
How did you know Aunt Kathy
gave us those wine glasses?
He would have written
these notes. Dupree, please!
Please stop making
excuses for him. I'm not.
But I think that he would
have if he... No, you are.
And you have to stop doing that now
because your buddy is wrong. Okay?
If he didn't want to write them,
he should have just told me.
And, big surprise,
he's late again.
Look, you know, forget him.
You made this beautiful meal.
Thank you.
We're gonna sit here
and we're gonna enjoy it.
We're gonna drink.
And we're gonna eat. And
we're gonna drink some more.
Well, it's frustrating
for me, too,
'cause I know he would have
loved this meal.
Yeah.
I can't do it...
Oh, boy.
No. But I used to be able to
touch it to the top of my nose.
No, really? Yeah. Oh,
wow. Can you do it?
No.
Hey, guys.
There's a plate
for you in the oven.
Okay, look,
I'm sorry I'm a little late.
I got hung up at work.
Would it have killed you
to make a phone call?
No, Randolph, Randolph, wait!
I'm sorry, Molly, but,
damn it, Carl, you really
press my buttons sometimes!
Is he kidding? No. Now
you've upset Randolph.
Randolph?
Randolph? You got to be kidding
me. I know a Randy Dupree.
I do not know a Randolph.
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe he prefers
to be called Randolph?
No, Molly,
it never occurred to me.
You know, the guy writes
some bullshit poetry
and suddenly he's
got a brand-new name.
That's funny. Turns out that's
not the only thing he writes.
Apparently, he is a whiz
at thank-you notes!
He told you about that?
It just kind of slipped out.
Oh, I bet it just
kind of slipped out.
Guy stabs his best friend in the
back. He's getting drunk with his wife.
What can I say, Carl? I'm
kind of fun to get drunk with.
Maybe you should try it sometime,
because I'm here every night!
Molly, I'd be delighted to try it
sometime, but unlike your friend, Dupree,
I've got a job!
And what was with
the groomsman shirt?
That was a one-time deal,
Molly.
He was trying to
look nice for you.
And why are you
coming down on Dupree?
He's the one who went through all
this effort to cook low carb for you.
You didn't even
bother to show up.
Low carb?
What the hell does that mean?
You know, he's on the whole health kick
with the bicycling and Lance Armstrong.
So he's just trying to help you
out. He's trying to help me out?
That's a laugh, Molly.
I'm the one who put
a goddamn roof over his head!
One. We put the roof
over his head.
And A. I mean, you haven't really
been taking care of yourself.
I can't remember
the last time you exercised.
And how many Twinkies
have you had today?
What are you talking about?
Oh, Carl, please.
There's, like,
a million Twinkie wrappers
on the floor of your car.
You're not fooling anybody.
All right. All right.
So I admit it,
I enjoy one occasionally.
Is there something
so wrong with that?
And, Molly, look, I am
under a great deal of stress.
What do you want from me?
Wait a minute. Is this the
kind of thing that turns you on?
Oh, Carl!
Is this what turns you on?
Come on, Molly. I was
reading an article on Oprah.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I can't be one
of your boy-band flavor of the weeks.
With their enhanced
frosted tips
and their washboard bellies
and their hairless backs!
What's happening to us, Carl?
I don't know what's happening to you,
Molly, but apparently I'm getting fat!
Nice. Looks like somebody's tired
of getting sand kicked in their face.
Good job. Good to see you
living strong, buddy.
Please. Would you
listen to yourself?
You get your first ten-speed bike,
and suddenly you're Lance Armstrong.
Let's leave
Lance out of this.
Guy's done more with one testicle
than you and I can do with three.
Now, listen. I know you're
under a lot of pressure at work
and you and Molly
are having some trouble.
Trouble? No.
I wasn't having any trouble
until you arrived, Randolph.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know what it means.
No, I don't.
You sold me out
with those thank-you notes.
And what's with this
Roman Holiday obsession?
I know you, Dupree.
Your favorite movie's Fletch:
No, sir. No, it's not. Fletch is in
my top five. It's not my favorite.
What's with the poetry? I think
you're trying to show me up.
Maybe I like poetry.
Did that ever occur to you?
Listen, if I got to be
the lovable fuckup all my life
to win your best friend prize,
maybe you should
keep your award.
I've got news for you, Dupree.
You're not that lovable.
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that, Carl.
Goodbye, Mr. Grumpy.
Sugar.
Top shelf, behind the honey.
Where?
Top shelf, behind the honey.
Oh, yeah.
You got to reach for it.
Yeah, right there.
Oh, God.
You gotta reach. Right
there. I'm reaching.
Oh, goodness.
Right there.
There's the sugar.
Right behind the honey.
Right there. You got it?
I got it.
Why do you do this to me?
Got it.
So good.
Bye, honey.
Hello. Yes.
Is Mandy there, please?
Is this Dupree
calling again?
Yes, this is Dupree again.
Get it through your head: Mandy
does not want to talk to you, okay?
Okay, yeah,
just tell her that I called.
Good night:
Thank you.
Looks like we're going
camping again, Murphy.
Oh, God!
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I didn't know you were down
here. No, it's my fault.
What in the hell is going on?
Nothing, honey. It's fine.
Nothing. Nothing.
Are you naked again?
No, no, no, it's fine.
We talked about this!
I know we did. Yes.
Everyone's asleep,
and here's lonely old Dupree
just waling away on himself. You
weren't waling away on yourself. It...
God! An animal wouldn't
debase himself thus.
What is happening to me? Is
this one of my tube socks?
Carl, please.
Answer the question!
Oh, my God.
Mine were dirty.
Carl, stop it! Relax.
Wait a minute. What are you
even doing down here, Molly?
Are you serious?
It's a simple question.
I couldn't sleep.
I'm getting a broom.
This is rock bottom.
I was doing so good.
Wasn't I doing good, Carl?
But, Dupree,
where did you find this?
I got it from that box marked
Carl's camping equipment
in the garage.
You put the box away,
didn't you? Yes. Yes.
I didn't realize you were
such an outdoorsman, Carl.
Asian Assault?
Molly, let me explain.
That one was in the wrong
section at the video store.
you're gonna lie to my face.
I thought it was a kung
fu movie with Bruce Lee.
Okay. Pacific Rim Job:
No idea.
All right. That one
I kind of knew about.
Oh, Beijing Bang Bang?
Carl! Is this what
our marriage has come to?
Lies and all these
Chinese fetish videos?
I'm just curious.
All right. I admit, Molly, that I was
into Asian porn for a little while.
But it was just a phase.
Anyway, why am I the one
who's on trial here?
He's in there starching my sock,
and you don't even bat an eyelash.
Because I'm not
married to him!
I am married to you.
Do something with that.
Is there anything worse
than having to throw away
your porn collection?
What's going on
with you and Molly?
You heard me.
Are you in love with my wife?
Have you lost your mind?
What are you talking about?
Dupree. Dupree,
just answer the question.
Whoa, hold on, Jake LaMotta.
I'm not gonna...
That's a sick question.
How come you can't answer it?
I'm not going to answer because
it doesn't deserve an answer.
How could you ask me
something like that?
You're very clever, Dupree.
You're living in my house.
You're going to town
on yourself in my living room.
And now you're moving
in on my wife. What?
You think you got it
all figured out,
but I'm on to you,
and you're out of here!
Oh, no. Hold on. You're
not throwing me out of here.
I'll leave! Good! And
while you're at it,
leave the flask
and the groomsman's outfit.
But you gave those to me.
Those were gifts.
All right! You know, keep
those. All those were gifts.
But leave the insignia.
Because that was
for my best man.
Hey. It's for the best.
The guy would have been
living off us forever.
Dinner is at 7:30, and my father
will be here at 7:00, so...
Molly.
With all things considered,
do you think that maybe
tonight isn't the best night
to have your father
over for dinner?
Carl. Carl.
Please don't be late.
Please.
So, I hear the albacore are
really biting this time of year.
It's not albacore season,
Carl.
Oh. Really?
I'll get that.
It's right over here.
Hello.
Hold on. Hey. Hey,
Carl. Carl. It's Neil.
Did you actually throw away
your porn collection?
Look, Neil,
I'm having a dinner party.
I'm coming to get it.
Going to Starbucks! Be back!
Carl, I read
your new presentation.
And how would you feel about
Tony taking it from here?
I hope you guys aren't
talking business now.
Let's keep it at the office.
No, no, no, not at all.
No, we were...
Oh, my God.
Is that Mom's crab cakes?
They sure are.
Rabbit, come here.
Excuse me.
Come here, rabbit.
They look exactly like Mom's.
I can't believe it.
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
Give it to Tony. Tony. Yeah.
Yeah. Want to give it to Tony?
Yeah, I have a pretty goddamn
big problem with that.
Is that what you're saying?
You'd be demoting me?
Tony deserves it!
Give it to Tony!
Do you think I care? Go ahead.
What are you doing?
Son of a...
Huh? Your father's got it out for me.
Oh, Carl!
No, no, no!
You know he asked me
to get a vasectomy?
He's crazy!
Carl, first of all, this is
my father you're talking about!
He's irrational.
Who...
You want...
What was that?
Oh, my God.
You. What the hell?
Oh, my God. Dupree!
What did I tell you?
Molly, don't.
I'm okay. I just slipped
on the drainpipe.
Come on.
Let's get in the house.
I didn't want to
bother you guys.
Put him out by the curb!
Carl.
Why am I getting blamed for
everything? What's going on here, Carl?
Daddy, will you please
grab Dupree's things?
I was just trying to get my stuff. What?
You know, Molly, I don't know that I
really have time for dinner. I might just...
You know, I really don't
want to impose. Here.
Maybe I... I know, but I...
No. You're staying.
You're gonna eat something.
It's fine. You're eating.
Here, have some salad.
It's good.
I put a little extra
balsamic like you like it.
Eat something.
Well, it does look tasty.
Thank you.
Sir?
That's a beautiful Schwinn
bike you got out there, Dupree.
Thank you. Although it's not
exactly state-of-the-art.
It's about 25 years old,
so sometimes I feel like it's tough to
keep up with the other riders on the road.
Now, I don't buy that.
Did you read Lance Armstrong's
book, It's Not About the Bike?
The bike. Touché.
And it's true.
It isn't about the bike.
It's about here.
It's about your heart.
And that's the truth.
And I've said it to Carl.
If you...
Did you see his seventh win?
The final one?
The last one?
I watched every stage.
Carl. Get the phone.
Me, too. I've watched every
single one of those races.
Did you ever cry?
Oh, yeah.
I defy you to watch
that and not cry.
Daddy? Excuse me. Could
you pass the wine, please?
What color was your bike?
Hello.
Hey, Carl.
Hey, hey. It's Neil.
Okay, so is it in, like, the
garbage, or did you recycle it?
Listen, you sleazebag.
Get off my property!
I'm tired of this crap! Get
the hell out of here! Go home!
Jackpot.
It's the wrong number.
You like to fish, Dupree?
I'm not the world's
greatest fisherman.
Although I did have
one pretty great adventure.
True story. Off the coast
of Baja during spring break,
I spent four days
reeling in this marlin.
Great, big, old shitkicker,
and I finally landed him.
Four days?
Well, I hope you mounted
that son of a bitch.
No. I didn't. Catch and
release, Bob. Honor the fish.
That's really noble.
Dupree. How would you like to
go fishing with me in my boat?
Really?
Yeah. Just the two of us.
Chick-a-boom. Chick-a-boom.
Why not?
Hey, Bob, is it just me, or
are the albacore really jumping?
You're funny.
What type of fool thinks
it's albacore season?
Dupree, from now on,
you call me "Dad. "
Yeah. Go out there.
Maybe bring Molly along.
Nice, Dupree.
Need some of this?
You sure you're
okay with this, Bob?
As long as it's not Carl, you
can do anything you want with her.
Poetry, Aunt Kathy, librarian-banging,
backstabbing, bike-riding,
couch-burning masturbator!
You ruined my life! You ruined my
life! Carl, get off of him! Stop it!
Get a hold of yourself!
Oh, my God! I will not
get a hold of myself!
This is my house!
Are you kidding me?
What are you gonna do,
hit me with that thing?
You gonna hit me?
Carl, stop it!
Come on! I dare you!
You dared me.
Don't tell me you want the porn
back, because you can't have it!
Why is it all Asian?
Whoa, what's with
the bag of frozen peas, man?
There was a little bit of
a blowout at the house.
My wallet's still there
and my car's boxed in.
It's not a big deal.
I need a place to stay.
I've got nowhere to go.
You want to stay here?
Yeah.
Yeah. That'll be fun.
That'll be really cool.
Let me ask Annie.
Yo, Annie.
Carl wants to stay here.
Carl?
Oh, really? I just got off the phone
with Molly. He tried to kill Dupree.
He cannot stay here.
He needs somewhere...
What are we gonna do?
Be afraid in my sleep? No!
Tell him to leave! Now! Now!
Okay. Fine. I said fine!
Look, I don't know what you did,
but she just talked to Molly.
She's freaked out
at you right now, man.
Neil, what are you saying? I can't
come into your house right now?
You cannot come in here.
She said so, man.
She makes the rules.
You know what?
I don't need this, Neil.
I don't need this.
I don't need this!
I'm sorry! Neil, get back in here!
She controls what I do!
Guys' night. Thursday.
I'll see you there.
Dr: Grayhead to the ER:
Dr: Grayhead to the ER:
Frankly, Molly, I'm
worried about your safety.
Maybe I should have Paco
come stay at the house.
Oh, Dad, please.
I don't need this right now.
Molly, I love you more than
anything, but you're an idealist.
You don't see the world
the way it is.
Dr: Navarro to 751:
Dr: Navarro to 751:
The doc says most of
my injuries are emotional.
Dad. I'm going to
ask you something,
and remember, you've never
lied to me before.
Do you ever really want
my marriage to work?
That's a really
complicated question, Molly.
No. Actually, it's not.
Dupree.
Molly? Molly.
Bob, before I go, I have
my own question for you.
And remember, you've never lied
to me either, as far as I know.
Who did you really want
to get a vasectomy?
Me? Or was it, in fact, Carl?
Take care of your neck,
Dupree.
Okay, Bob.
Carl?
He didn't come home
last night.
He loves you, Molly.
I know. I know.
Maybe it's just not enough.
It has to be enough.
It is enough.
Dupree, you gotta piece this
beautiful thing back together again.
By God, it took 36 years, 9 months, and
23 days for the mother ship to speak.
Well, guess what?
Dupree hears you.
Okay, gather around! Come on!
Everybody, gather around! Over here!
What's going on, Dupree?
I'm gonna tell you what's
going on. We got an emergency.
That's why I gave you
permission to miss school.
Now, listen. Carl's missing.
He ran away
from home last night.
It's up to us to find him.
And here's the deal.
I don't know
what he's capable of.
If he attacks you, go limp.
Play dead.
That's what I did,
and I think it saved my life.
Toshi, pass out these fliers.
Give them to everybody.
Okay, Nancy, go to Neil's
house. Okay, I'm on it.
Go. Go! Cesar, get up here.
I want you to hit the
grocery store. Got it.
Thompson Land Development.
Danger! Be careful here.
Go! Go! Fall out!
And if you see him, call
someone. Do the buddy system. Run!
I'm just looking for this guy, Carl
Peterson, if you see him. Right here.
I've just lost my friend.
Carl Peterson.
Here you go. Just stand there.
Put your head through this.
Carl!
Here you go. There you go.
Looking for a friend. That's all.
And he took his hat. That was
real. His American Legion hat.
The colonel. Give us a break.
Just came in
to make a pit stop.
Well, that's good
'cause your cot's been taken.
What's he talking about?
How's Becca doing?
Is she coming in later?
In case you think
I'm still in love with Molly,
maybe you should
take a look at these.
They're all about Mandy.
Love poems.
Sonnets.
Little ditties, haikus.
I loved her.
How come you never told me
you wrote poems?
I don't know. I guess I
figured you'd call me a homo.
Well, I guess I might have.
Listen, if there's one thing I
know about, it's loving and losing.
But you can't lose unless
you stop waiting. And...
Look, Dupree. Listen,
I'm really not in the mood
for one of your soliloquies.
My life's in the shitter
right now. Yes, it is.
But what are you
gonna do? Quit?
So what if you made some
mistakes. Everybody does.
So what if her dad hates you.
You think you're the first guy
to be hated by his father-in-law?
So what if he beat your ass
with a candlestick.
That's probably
happened before.
The point is, is somewhere along
the road, you lost your magic.
They knocked you off your game. Your
Carlness went right out the window.
What's with this "Carlness"?
It's not even a real word.
Yes, it is.
It's a verb.
It's a conjunction,
a preposition, it's a
philosophy, a way of life.
It's your name
with "ness" attached to it.
Bullshit. There's never
been any Carlness.
There's just Carl.
Well, I'm glad we got that
straightened out. My mistake.
You know, the truth is,
I never really thought you and
Molly were right for each other.
There was something about her I
never bought, right from Jump Street.
That whole, "Hey, look at me.
I'm a great person.
"I'm always smiling. I'm pretty. I'm
smart. I work with inner city kids. "
Get the hell out of there. I saw
through that sham, and you did, too.
And if you want to know the
truth, frankly, I'd blame her.
Now, wait a minute!
No, I won't hold it!
Hold on a second! Your life is
going to hell in a hand basket!
Molly is the best damn thing
that ever happened to me.
Leave her out of this.
Sure she is.
Did you see what just
happened? When I tricked you?
All of a sudden you had that
instinct to fight, that Carlness.
That's what this situation
needs. It's crying out for it.
You're trying to get it back,
that fight, the will to fight.
You're thinking.
Come on. What do you got?
Dupree, get your helmet.
Paco's on duty.
Hey, can you get me 10 minutes
in there? I'll get you 15.
Hold on a second. He's a
lot faster than he looks.
Hello there. Have a
message I need to deliver.
Do you have identification?
No.
You kidding me?
Just got the old bike here.
Pretty obvious
I'm a bike messenger.
What are you, Samoan?
What do you think?
Could be Greek. Could be Italian.
Either way, you're a big man.
It's okay,
I specialize in big men.
Where is your message?
I keep 'em up here.
Saves on the paperwork.
All right. Have a good day.
Maybe I'll see you around.
Come on.
Hold it.
They said you were quick.
Easy now, big 'un. I got to tell
you, you're catching me on a day
where I'm throwing seven
different kinds of smoke.
Yeah? Let's see them.
That's what I thought.
That's number one.
Baby wants to play chase?
Okay, let's chase.
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.
Up or down? Up or down?
Down!
Gotcha.
Missed! Number two.
Mr. Peterson-Thompson?
Where is he?
Stop! Stop!
Guy in chair. Number three.
Did you see that? I got him.
lock down the building.
That was my number four.
What's number five? I can't
tell you. I don't know myself.
Nice job, weasel.
Now it's on!
Number five, invisible.
What is he doing?
You can manufacture
these for $90 a square foot.
You sell them
at $400 a square foot.
You got 25 in this
whole arena right here.
I even think you can
do the advertisement,
"Fifty million
square feet. 
Come here, weasel!
Number six.
Open the door.
I need a number seven.
I need a number seven!
You want Samoa?
I'll give you Samoa!
Hello. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Pardon me.
You know,
for the last 14 hours,
all I've thought about
is kicking your ass.
Don't make me look
for another candlestick, Carl.
I've taken you down once.
I could do it again.
Not today, Bob. Not today.
I'll go get Paco.
Yeah. You go get Paco.
You've done everything
you can to undermine me.
You've tried to intimidate me.
You've tried to humiliate me.
You bastardized my project to the
point where it's unrecognizable.
But here's the thing, Bob.
I don't care.
I don't care about this job,
and I don't care about you.
I care about Molly.
She means everything
in the world to me.
And if you're going to stand in the
way of me trying to win her back,
you'd better bring
a pretty big candlestick.
Carl?
Hey, Carl.
You... Will you all excuse us?
Can everybody go?
You know, Carl,
I've been thinking
maybe I was a little
rough on you. A little?
But you got to understand,
you know, I love Molly, too.
And I've been having a really,
really tough time letting go of her.
You asked me to
get a vasectomy.
Yeah, that was
a little excessive.
I apologize.
I'm not gonna
hyphenate my name, Bob.
I know.
Hey. There's Carl and Dupree.
Dupree found Carl.
He's on his own now.
Molly?
Molly?
Molly.
I'm sorry.
Don't ever walk out
on me again.
Ever.
I know. I lost it.
I didn't know
what I was doing anymore.
Well, Carl, I don't always
know what I'm doing, either.
But we are in this together,
when it's good, when it's bad.
Yeah.
I mean, so you launched yourself
across our dining room table
at your best friend
like a crazy person.
I guess I...
But, Carl,
I know who you are.
And I love who you are.
And that's why we don't
walk out on each other.
I love you, Molly.
And I promise you,
I'm not going anywhere.
Yes! My work is done here.
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Come on! Let's go! Go!
Who wants some ice cream? Go
down there and you get it. Go!
Yeah!
Life may knock you down:
Scratch that:
I'm okay.
Life will knock you down.
It'll kick you in the gut
and knock you to the curb.
But you can't let it
rob you of your "ness. "
Now what's "ness"?
It's your name plus "ness. "
You, sir, white-haired
gentleman, what's your name?
My name's Joe.
No! It's Joeness.
You follow me? Listen to me.
Hang on to that, and as long as
you do, you'll always be ready.
Because when that moment comes,
and trust me, it will come,
that's when you start throwing
seven different
kinds of smoke!
The mother ship hears you!

and loss of innocence.
And, um, the exploitation of innocence,
um, always appeals to me...
because, again,
that happened in Tommy.
And it certainly began to happen
with Tom and Barry...
the way they were bought.
Conjoined twins. Desolate location.
Cut off from everything.
Where they are. Where they grow up.
They're sold by their own father...
and they move out into the world.
What happens to them then?
L mean, it's all, uh, incredibly gothic.
these terrible nightmares.
She thought
she was expecting triplets.
Doctors got it wrong.
And Mum passed away
the next day.
Never even saw 'em.
And there they were,
my two brothers.
Joined together.
Just here at the chest.
Peas in a pod.
The doctors wanted to try
a separation surgery...
but Father would have none of it.
It was bad enough he'd lost his wife.
He wasn't havin'the doctors
messin'about with his boys.
Father took us off
to live out on the Head.
Didn't let no one near us.
No one knew us.
We didn't go to school
like other kids.
Dad taught us everything.
They were grand times.
L trod the boards before l could walk.
L did a double act with me mum.
Zelda and Little Zak.
Ever heard of'em?
Music business now is no different
to what it was then.
People want a show.
Punters wanna see something
a bit different.
back in the late '50s and '60s...
you know, if l'm being honest,
Zak Bedderwick was the king.
Whatever, whoever he wanted,
he had.
He reckoned The Noize was gonna be
the new Small Faces.
That Chris Dervish was gonna be
the new Steve Marriot.
The band collapsed when Chris Dervish,
the lead singer...
took his 1968 Ford Shelby
for a swim in Staines Reservoir.
had left Zak Bedderwick bruised...
and pretty battered.
He hadn't had a pop hit
of any kind for some years.
Uh, by 1974, he was ready to,
uh, raise the stakes.
When my father signed that contract...
he believed he'd secured Tom and Barry
an income.
If you would just sign there, please.
to look after themselves.
So many wanted to claim them.
In some ways even more now
than when they were alive...
but there's never been, like,
any real concern or love.
The contract stipulated that
Bedderwick Walker Entertainments...
would own exclusive publishing rights
to the Howe Twins' music.
In return, Albert Howe and his sons...
were guaranteed a substantial salary...
payable monthly
for a period of one year.
Hand on my heart,
l never exploited anyone...
who didn't want to be exploited.
Then Mr. Couling took them away.
L never thought l'd be in a rock band.
I thought we might get away from the Head
and l thought we might go and get a job, but-
at Christmas and that, we'd always get on some old-
Like, well, just generally,
we'd always like get on, like-
But l-I think- l don't know,
we've got something special.
L mean, everyone
who's ever been famous...
has always had something that's special
to them, and we've got something special.
ever, ever be - [Man #2] Doing an interview.
with a band and doing this-
Someone recording an interview with us.
always been, like, sort of a-a dream.
All right, hello, mate.
L just want a kind of a nice, happy vibe,
but l'm gonna introduce you to the boys.
Sucking it out, but holding it.
This is- This is amazing stuff really.
Looking at it after all these years.
It was a weird place.
Zak created this-
this magical wonderland.
And he had every freak
in the world there.
But, of course, the boys
were the main attraction.
It was all about them.
going on myself at the time...
so they were gonna give me
a few bucks a week...
all my expenses, and l was gonna
have the opportunity...
to shoot whatever l wanted
to about this- this weird idea.
Perfect.
You can also play it here. Right?
Okay, now...
hold 'em tight, press 'em down,
and just play those three.
You're goin' like this. - Listen to him.
Just play the things that you want.
It's all right. It's all right.
Most of the chords, you know,
you can put them anywhere.
You can write a fucking song with that.
Keep doing that.
Make sure you've got it
in your head.
L'm gonna put a song on.
Doot-doot.
Don't argue.
l'm not.!
And listen.
Are you ready?
L want you
to listen to this, right?
Then all l have to teach you
is to play...
another couple of chords
and you've got the song, mate.
Me and Zak go back to,
like, the mid-'60s.
He was always getting me in
to babysit the new kids.
Zak wanted
singing Siamese twins...
and he wanted them pop.
The name was his idea,
The Bang Bang.
It was my job
to sort the boys out musically.
L can't reach. L hurt my fingers.
Well, it's gonna hurt, isn't it?
Get off. You're getting in the way.
You're fucking it up!
We need to get
that plectrum now, don't we?
Where have you put it?
Well, Barry threw it.
No, l didn't.
Barry, look, at some point
you're gonna have to play it.
See what l'm doing?
You're gonna have to learn this
stuff at some point.
No way.
Have a sing, then.
Sing it. Yeah, that's a good idea. Sing it.
Keep going. A-
Have a beer.
We'll share it.
Thanks, Paul.
You're welcome.
Keep going. E, A, E.
Drink a bit more and then it'll be in tune.
Maybe that's what we'll do.
We'll string a load of those together.
Bottle solo from Baz.
Ooh, ooh.
Reload.
he give me a call to take me on.
An apprenticeship, he called it.
My future
in the entertainment industry.
Ooh, fucking hell, he's there.!
Oh, he's got it. Georgie Best.!
Georgie Best!
That's what they were like.
A real shock.
He told me, but he didn't tell me,
if you know what l mean.
Two-one! Two-one!
Just his henchman, you know?
Unpaid asswipe.
Handling all those freaks
was just another shitty gig to me.
Here.
Paul. Paul.
Look, give the other one a guitar, eh?
Give 'em both a guitar. It'll look good.
No, trust me, give 'em one each. Yeah?
Give 'em this one.
There you go.
Here you are, Barry. Barry.
No, it'll look good. Eh?
It's a stupid idea.
Um, let's just start- Let's just-
Fucking hell!
to say to me, Barry?
You should turn it off.
It's a fucking joke.
with Barry right from the start, you know.
So l used to hose him down
if he got out of control.
No, l'm serious.
You know, with kids and that-
You've gotta have
a firm hand, ain't ya?
he was always holding something back.
There was always something else
going on with him.
L mean, a lot of people's take was
he's mischievous, he's a country kid...
but, no, l think very deep.
L think it was something
that ran real deep with him.
It's all gonna end in a couple years.
It doesn't make a difference.
L'd like to be going home.
You ever dream?
Why does he have to come in?
Well, he's gotta see it, mate.
He's gotta see it.
So l have to- l have to get him in.
But it's fine. You know, all it is,
we'll just go through this.
He'll see, uh, you know,
how much you've improved.
Look, boys, l mean...
do it for me, you know, 'cause-
'cause l'll get shit on...
if-if l'm not seen to be doing my job, so-
Let's just bloody do it.
You have to. L can't get around it.
You gotta do it.
And at some point you've gotta
do it in front of an audience, so-
l mean, you know,
Nick's the least of your worries.
spoken about Nick Sidney...
and how he interacted
with Tom and Barry.
Why did you stand by when these kids
were getting beaten up?
Fuck off!
Fuck off, Eddie!
What are you fucking
still doing here, eh?
What's going on?
The roof.
What are you doing up there?
Both of you, down now!
Fuck off!
Do you-Jesus!
Tom, what do you think
you're playing at? This is silly.
Eddie, fuck off!
What was that?
Do you wanna be in the band?
Jesus Chr- Little bastard.!
Swear to God, if you don't come down-
No, we won't now.!
You will not be in a band.
L will take you home!
Do you want it?
You fucking cunt, you'll be out of a job
if you take us home.!
You need us more than we need you.!
What's Zak gonna say then, eh?
Yeah, sure, there was a bad vibe, you know.
Barry was out of control, so what?
Barry delivered when he was
under the cosh, yeah?
The treatment l give him worked.
Yeah?
That's you.
that we took the next step.
He called me. He said the boys need a band,
and they need an original song.
Their signature, if you like.
The only brief he gave me,
he wanted something a bit sexy.
So l thought, okay, well,
we've got two Siamese twins-
Well, you know,
a pair of Siamese twins...
so l called up Tubs Puller,
the ex-Noize drummer.
And l knew this art school kid,
Spitz, on guitars.
And l was on bass.
Here we go.
Well, "Two-Way Romeo,"
if you listen to the lyrics...
it'll tell you what it's about.
And then the chorus again.
Now don't do that to his hair.
Fuck's sake.
What are you doing? Get off!
What's a matter?
Don't flick cigarettes in my hair.
for the boys to do their first live gig.
He wanted to know up front
whether or not to cut his losses.
Ah, we're gonna play down at this,
uh, grotty little pub in Stokey.
But it had a great reputation
for good new bands.
we had, uh, music three nights a week.
Deejays Wednesdays.
Bands Fridays and Saturdays.
Now they'd rather have a meal.
Yeah, the bands used
to just walk through here.
There's a bar along here.
And over there in the corner
was the little stage.
Really nasty.
At Humbleden,
these guys were protected.
But suddenly they were
thrust into this audience.
They were dead nervous.
they're shouting things out
at them, things like, uh...
you know, "Who's these two poofs
coming on cuddling each other?"
Get off. Get off, you queer wankers.!
Everybodyjust froze.
Everyonejust froze.
Out of the blue-
l'll never forget this-
Barry just grabs the mike stand
and starts screaming the lyrics.
L mean, really snarling it out.
L'd never seen anything like that before.
throwing things at them.
And then one of the lads just-
he just started kind of
taunting the audience back.
Barry's lifting his shirt up.
Tempting them, you know?
Showing them kind of where
the join was.
Everyone in that audience
thought it was a gag.
Show it, show it, show it!
And then he just rips open his shirt...
and you just see
this incredible, you know...
band of skin joining them together.
It was like a freak show.
It was like, "Here l am. Fuck you."
no filming that night.
Just in case they flopped.
Well, they didn't flop.
That was The Bang Bang.
L called Zak straight away.
Zak, you got a band. It's working.
Happy Christmas.
That's a special
from Mr. Bedderwick, mate.
There's a letter
in there as well.
Let's have a look.
Just gently, lads, gently, gently.
something with this.
With great expectations.
Zak Bedderwick."
Look, it means a lot to him,
that sheet music.
What is it, Tom? Show me.
Every Little Moment.
The Hilton Sisters.
Words and music by BobbyJones.
Featuring the phenomenal success,
The Hilton Sisters.
Yeah, they were another Siamese act.
Siamese sisters?
Well, what does
he want us to do with it?
You figure it out, boys.
God, right.
Go on then, sing it.
It's not a fucking joke.
Come on.
It sounds like one
of our dad's old songs-
l don't care what it sounds like.
Change it, do something with it, yeah?
We'll change it. We'll change it.
Whole idea of it was
it was Zak's blessing.
It was. It was his blessing.
It was his way of saying "Go ahead,
make an album. Go for it. L'll pay for it."
L mean, Zak-
Zak thought it was just
a matter of, you know...
padding out a couple of catchy hits
with a few extra tunes.
Oh, come on!
All right!
Nobody else. L wanted it to be
me in the room. It felt like it was.
The boom, boom, bang, bang thing?
Really buzzing from it. Brilliant.
My ears are ringing. L've been so upset.
L didn't care anymore, because-
Doesn't matter what you look like,
what you dress like.
We're here to dance.
My mum's gonna kill me when she finds out.
When he undid his shirt,
we kind of fancied them.
If they can do that, then we can
do anything. - That's fucking rocking.
me to get the photo for the album sleeve...
the record sleeve, you know, and, um-
Well, l was going to do
this kind of Fontainebleau.
You know, the two women
that are holding each other's nipples.
Well, one's holding the other one.
L thought that, you know,
with the play, with the twins...
with the join-with the girls,
with the masks.
And then Barry, he took the whole thing
completely out of my hands.
The girls didn't know.
L didn't- l just thought
l've got to go with this.
Tom was- He was a little studious boy
that wanted to be a good musician...
that wanted to get it right...
that wanted to please me,
and Barry wanted to fuck with me.
Testosterone-
That's what happened.
That's what l'm talking about.
They're threatening to do an exposé-
Muckraking.
They're talking freaks, Henry.
Talking cruel training methods.
that the information in this proposed article...
comes within any appreciable distance
ofbeing accurate?
L know thejournalist. So do you.
Laura Ashworth?
Laura Ashworth?
Laura Ashworth was a slapper, mate.
If you're in trouble...
and you need a friend...
Laura Ashworth is the last person
you want coming around the corner.
Maybe a cowbell.
Hello.
How are you, sweetheart?
Good to see you.
Look at you.
This is Laura. Laura Ashworth.
Bit old for a groupie, aren't you, darling?
Actually, no, l don't think l am.
Do you?
Yeah.
That's right. You are correct.
L am Tom.
Good to meet you, Tom.
This is George.
L thought it was Barry.
Hi, l'm George.
George. Do you mind if l call you Barry?
Look, he's joking. L'm actually Barry.
Call me Georgina if you want.
L'm Barry. Shake my hand.
Touch my hand.
Hello.
L'm Barry.
Bloody hell.
Same old same old, ain't it?
What is she doing here?
Haven't you been told?
She's gonna write your autobiography.
No, l'm not writing your autobiography.
No, l know you're not.
See you later.
So, are you a music journalist then or-
Well, not quite, but the, um-
l'm writing for an academic publication.
gonna be in an academic publication.
Academic publication no less.
So what are you writing about?
Well, you guys specifically.
you're kind of-you know,
you're-you're different.
Young and exciting and, you know-
What else? Young, exciting-
Give me- Give me a third.
Listen, l'm-l'm actually writing an article
about exploitation of the physically impaired.
Speak to Tubs. He's got a dodgy ankle.
Of course, l had this image
of these two young victims...
these poor defenseless boys
that were being totally exploited.
And then...
when l see these-these-these-these...
young, vibrant men with this energy
and this presence, and...
it just threw me totally.
When Mr. Bedderwick approached me...
with the, um, Laura Ashworth problem...
l suggested he took her on the payroll.
L knew she wouldn't be able
to resist recapturing her past.
And l knew she wouldn't be able
to resist the twins.
No- Child psychology.
of other bands and stuff, Laura?
Um, unofficially, yes.
Off the record. On the QT.
No.
Barry- l have to keep him on a lead.
Is that yourjob, between the two of you?
Yes.
Yeah. That's my job.
How do you feel about the people
at Humbleden?
You like them?
Yeah, well, the- You know, there's
lots of - And Mick and Aaron and-
Felix.
Ben.
in particular that you, um...
you get on with more than-
Ask him about Adelle.
Adelle.
Just a girl l like.
Just a girl.
Oh, really? Is there interest already?
You wanna ask Tom about that.
No, it's not important.
Am l embarrassing you?
No, don't-
It's my songbook. It's what l write chords in.
about Adelle? - [Tom] No.
It says you-says you wanna...
says you wanna have sex with her.
Says you wanna have sex with Adelle.
What? Oh, what?
Tommy does.
Tommy-Tommy wakes up in the night,
what, talking about Adelle and that...
and-and that he wants to-
He wants to touch her bum.
No. Shut up.
And-And he fiddles.
Rubs himself up and down at night.
He does. He does.
He does. He wakes up in the night-
And l can feel the bed rolling around
and l know it's-
Just shut up, Barry.
He likes to touch himself?
Barry, just shut up.
Does Tommy likes to touch himself?
Tommy likes to touch himself!
Tommy likes to touch himself!
Tommy likes to touch himself!
Tommy fiddles with himself!
Tommy's a bit sensitive today.
He hasn't had his normal
morning wank.
Probably heard it all before.
Probably wanked boys off yourself.
Barry.
and take your boots off.
Okay, um- So, can l ask you what-
what happened there?
He speaks the truth.
Who does?
Hasn't got a name. He's just there.
Hejust sits there.
Nothing- Nothing's there.
Just sometimes.
L'm just interested to know, um-
Sieg Heil.! Sieg Heil.!
Sieg Heil.! Sieg Heil.!
In the first series of ugly scuffles...
47 left-wing protesters were arrested.
Tension rose still higher as the National
Front march, well over 1,000 strong...
reached the entrance to Red Lion Square.
Their way was blocked by the left-wingers,
and both sides were kept apart by the police.
L noticed that Tom was writing stuff down.
He had a lot of ideas.
Um, so l let him-let him,
you know, just-just go with it.
L mean, it was like an explosion of stuff.
If you listen to the lyrics
of the songs, it was very small.
It was all about really the places
they came from.
They always had an edge.
They always had a sense of danger.
Two to one, and one is three.
Are you you, or are you me?
Now you tell me what that's about.

L had two myself.
Doola and Dawla.
They lived in my shoes.
L don't know what the boys called theirs.
Bury me.
Kill me.
friend brought all those terrible nightmares.
is we got lots of rubber bands, right?
You got the lyrics there?
As long as we're in together, be all right.
Whoo!
Go, Tommy.
Too fucking right.!
One more time!
didn't forget that they were actually...
physicallyjoined together,
because they were two very different people.
L found the way Tom held his...
silence was attractive.
And Barry was...
vulnerable and...
l tapped into that very quickly...
and, although
he made me feel uncomfortable...
because he was so in your face
a lot of the time...
um, l just wanted to-
protect him, really.
They're-They're-They're
right through-
They're right through these posh girls, hang
out, whatever, they've got the education...
you know-
You know, they lead-
lead people astray, mate,
lead people astray.
It's, um, generally held that...
conjoined twins should be separated,
whenever medically possible, as early as possible.
The Howes were omphalopagus,
um, joined at the lower chest...
as were the original Siamese twins,
Chang and Eng Bunker.
Tom and Barry Howes'circulatory system
was interconnected.
And in addition,
they shared a liver.
An operation to separate the twins
would have been accompanied...
by extraordinary dangers,
given the medical knowledge of that time.
Especially as Barry had been born
with a congenital heart defect...
which made him the weaker sibling.
However, l have no doubt that
that would have been the correct decision.
They were born in Siam.
And they were like-
They could have cut themselves apart.
You got a bread knife,
'cause that's probably better...
but this is like- like
a hot knife through butter, that is.
Bye-bye, Bar. Bye-bye, Barry.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Barry.
Might do. Might not.
Could do.
Could not.
Are you guys gonna have kids?
Don't know.
Are you gonna have a kid?
Huh. Imagine if l had twins.
Imagine if l had triplets.
Imagine if l had quads.
Imagine if l had-
Sextuplets.
Five-teplets.
If l had conjoined twins-
l would cut 'em down the middle,
like a slice of bread.
That's right.!
Um, l think Ken Russell should stick
to Women In Love...
which l think is brilliant.
But like a lot of biopics,
you know, um...
they miss the essence...
the essential beauty.
What else do you want?
Oh, darling.
Thank you very much.
Oh, Laura.
You're a star.
You're my wonderful woman.
Excuse me.
Adelle?
That's just how l like them.
Something l can dunk my soldiers in,
if you know what l mean, Laura.
Do you like dunking your soldiers, Barry?
L love to dunk my soldier.
You love it when l dunk my soldier,
don't you, Laura?
Shut up, Barry.
Oh, hard.
Never mind, never mind.
Would you like some toast?
No, just on its own, thanks.
L reckon what we should do...
just to make this beautiful
sunny morning even better-
Does it look nice?
L love it.
Thank you, Barry.
You look very pretty, Laura. You do.
You look very pretty this morning actually.
What, Tommy?
Soldier?
to you # - Play something else, Tom.
Tom.
Tom, try another fuckin' song.
Tom, you've been playing that song
for the last fucking half an hour.
It wasn't an ideal situation,
and l know that, you know.
And l had my own anger
and frustration about it.
L fell in love with Tom.
You can't choose
who you fall in love with.
Rock and roll.
it was like he was fighting for his life.
It was like hejust wanted that-
to keep going.
L think he was afraid it would stop.
L think the thought of not having
that kind of sense of- of power maybe.
A sense of being wanted,
being adored.
L think that frightened Barry a lot.
Fuck off!
Stop it!
Stop it!
All right, Tom, you're right.
What are you doing?
Get off!
Go!
Get off.
but one time in particular...
Barry actually threatened Tom
with a knife.
And it got very real.
the Howe brothers on a single occasion...
just once, after one of those, um...
violent episodes
that they were prone to.
And it was here that l discovered
something very interesting.
This dark patch.
A... growth of some kind.
Now, Barry's, um, mood swings
and restlessness and general paranoia...
are indicative of amphetamine abuse...
but those symptoms
can also be attributed to a tumor.
There have been cases
where one twin is encapsulated...
in a cyst or tumor
inside the other.
It's- It's known as fetus in fetu.
There was a case of a farmer, age 28...
who went to the doctor
complaining of a stomachache.
He was found to have
a 13-pound fetal twin inside his abdomen.
On opening the head of the fetus,
two additional fetuses were found...
in the cranial cavity.
It's conceivable that Barry Howe
harbored the rudiments...
of a third fetus in his cranium.
A lot of people have asked me about-
this-this third head on the shoulders
of the brothers.
In the novel,
l just simply didn't believe it...
because things don't grow like that.
Whereas, a sort of growth on the-
on the back of the neck, these things...
are medically documented in such cases.
144, take 12.
But l did think it was
a wonderful metaphor for their, um-
for their genius, if you like.
It was as though it-it contained
the essence of their being.
No, no, love. Sorry.
Sorry, sweetheart. Our present.
What do you reckon, Barry?
Tommy wants one.
Shall we let Tommy do a line? You want to do a big
one, Tommy?- Tommy, you're gonna be in our club.
Can you do a big one, Tom?
Yeah.
Leave some for me, all right?
Tommy can do a big one.
No. Hold it.
Tommy's doin' a big one.
You're not on it, not even on it.
Get it. Get it. Get it all.
Get it all.
Come here.
Tommy, you naughty boy.
Tommy-
You want another?
You want a bigger one?
Tommy wants a bigger one.
Wash it down, Tommy. Wash it down.
Tommy's fucked off that his girlfriend
isn't here tonight. Aren't ya, Tommy?
What do you reckon?
Says Tommy does not want another one.
Tommy does not want another one.
Barry, what else does he say?
He says it's time
for you to go now, Bob.
Says we're sailin' on,
so we don't need you anymore.
See ya later.
Bye. We're goin' now.
No more.
That is the last time you will do it.
You remember-
Sit down for 10 minutes.
No, l'm all right. L just want to get up.
Tommy. Sit down.
L'm all right.
Sit down.
If you stopped
and tried to change the world...
every time you've got
the camera turning...
um, l guess you'd never make a film
and maybe you shouldn't.
Maybe you should never be there.
For l know one thing, we should have
had a psychiatrist at Humbleden.
You know, if you're going to push
all those buttons with people's psyches...
somebody should be there, qualified
to handle it when it gets out of control.
Is there anyone here tonight
called William?
William? Is there a William?
You're a fuckin' cunt.
Get off the stage. Off!
Put your arm around me, Barry.
Put your arm around me.
Get the door, Tom.
Get 'round the fucking front.
Get in the back.
Get in the back.
What? Beat it!
Where are you, Tom?
What can you see?
Where's Barry gone?
He's whispering in his ear.
He's whispering-
Who's whispering? Tom?
Is Barry whispering?
Growing out the sand.
What's it saying, Tom?
He's getting out.
He's getting out. Oh-
Shh. Tom, it's just a bad dream.
Just a bad dream.
There's nothing going on
with the band.
Everything is good, Mr. Bedderwick.
Well, you'll see for yourself,
won't you? You'll see for yourself.
And when you see for yourself,
you'll be very, very happy.
Tom, how's it going?
It's great, Eddie. It's great.
It's really great.
Yeah? What's happening?
Oh, Barry did a monster one, didn't he?
You don't have to answer
his questions, Tom.
Tom does one, Barry does one.
Goes in a circle, doesn't it, Barry?
Why do you think Barry eats itself?
Eats itself, don't it, Barry?
What's happening, Baz?
What's happening with you?
Tom does one.
One.
Barry does one.
No!
Barry does one.!
L know as time went on that...
Tom became less and less happy...
with his situation, and...
l know that may have been
something to do with me...
but if it wasn't me, it would have been
somebody else, you know, and...
l think he wanted his freedom.
The emotional and intellectual lives
of conjoined twins...
are entwined in a-
in a highly complex way.
There may be a physical separation
that is successful, but...
in my opinion,
l think it's very, very difficult...
to have a successful
emotional severance.
Fuck all to do with me.
Stop playing for two minutes.
Read it.
It's to Laura.
Where's Laura?
Where's Laura?
Where is Laura?
Where is Laura?
L don't know.
Paul, what does it say?
Um- It's from some doctor.
"Come in for a consultation"...
with reference to fucking
separating 'em.
To Laura.
L received this letter from
Laura Ashworth...
acting on behalf of the twins.
The gist is they wished to explore
the possibility of separation.
L didn't send that letter
to Allardyce Stevens.
Who else would have wrote
a letter like that?
Who would else, you know,
who would have had the connections?
Who would have known them
sort of people, you know?
Of course it came from Laura.
Got to, ain't it?
Sort of thing she would have done.
L have serious doubts that both twins
would have survived the operation.
As it was,
my response went unanswered.
L never heard from them
or Laura Ashworth again.
Bedderwick, you know,
he went fucking ape shit.!
He said that bitch had to go.
Someone had to shut her up.
L left because Tom didn't ask me
to stay, really.
You know, he didn't...
say anything, he didn't back me up.
He-
a position to defend myself.
Or l didn't feel l was then, anyway.
Really, l was set up.
Well, if you ask me, l think Tom
guessed who sent the letter.
So, are you guys gonna get separated?
Maybe when one of us-
He says...
when one of us dies...
then we both die.
Together.
We go together.
Go together.
Yeah.
Sounds fucking good.
Yeah.
It sounds fucking brilliant.
So let's get the bass right.
Tom was a very cool customer.
l don't think he knew
how angry he was.
l think- l think that he was
a walking time bomb.
This is a special night for The Bang Bang.
First, we'd like to welcome
the record company people.
And, of course, Mr. Zak Bedderwick.
We're up here, are we? Rita's fine.
She didn't wanna come tonight?
No, no, no, no. Not tonight.
Next time.
Tammy, have a nice evening.
Pleased to meet you.
Hi, how you doing?
A lot of you have been
here before.
You have seen 'em many,
many a fucking time.
So you know what's coming,
don't you?
Who do you want?
Who do we fucking want?
So here they are, The Bang Bang.
Is there anyone
out there called Zak?
This one's for you, Zak.
What you give, you get back.
That's what we were trying to do.
It was something
to do with the future.
And Barry and Tom just took it
into a different place.
Just build and build and build,
and it was fucking wonderful.
Cry!
Here.
Impossible to see
exactly what happened.
L didn't see.
L was, um-
l couldn't get to them.
There's the guitar being lifted,
right there.
Now where's Barry?
There's a few rumors going around.
Some people said they saw this.
Some people said they saw that,
but you can't-
that Barry had been struck.
Look how anguished
Tom is here.
L just think that he snapped.
by then, and Tom was, uh-
He was shaking when he come out.
He didn't speak or nothing.
White.
L didn't see the twins.
Nick bundled them off.
Got them back to Humbleden.
All l know is that they were
in bad shape.
It's a long time ago, mate.
Long time ago.
to the big house to collect my brothers...
they were in a terrible state.
And no one could tell me
what happened. It was, um-
Tom was crying.
In anger.
And fear too.
And Barry...
just stared.
It's like he wasn't there at all.
Unbury me.
Unbury me.
"You better take us home, Robbie," Tom says.
So l did.
Who's burying me?
l can't- l can't breathe.
Can't breathe. L can't breathe.
Can't breathe.
Help me.
Shall we do it, Tommy?
Go on. One, two, three.
You hold the other side.
Go on. L'll close my eyes.
You hold the other side.
Go on, do it.
Hold the other side.
All right.
Ready?
One, two, three.
Ooh.
Oh, look away a minute,
look away a minute.
Yeah, l've done it.
Done it.
L just can't be bothered to move.
No.
Here's where l found 'em.
They were-
They were huddled together.
It was like they were sleeping.
Like when they were little kids.
L'm not sure if Barry had died first,
but Tom...
you could see where he'd tried
to sever himself...
from his brother.
Help me.
Where are you, Tom?
What can you see?
Where's Barry gone?
He's whispering in his ear.
He's whispering.
Who- Who's whispering, Tom?
He doesn't have a name.
He doesn't-
Shh. Tom, it's just a bad dream.
It doesn't have a name.

With Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out
and that only exacerbates things.
What do you mean?
You guys hardly get on, do you?
No, what does "exacerbate" mean?
It means to make things worse.
Right, right.
Well, I mean, it's not that
I don't like David and Di, you know.
Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
It's all right.
And I do want to spend time with you.
It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends.
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?
Anybody?
No, thank you.
I know...
friends are important to Shaun
but you must set some
quality time aside for yourselves.
Daffs is always taking me
to see these listed buildings
and I'm always dragging him to the theatre.
I'm not so hot on theatre.
How about a meal?
It's your anniversary soon.
It was last week.
Did you do anything special?
We came here.
Shaun. Hog lumps.
Shaun, what I'm trying to say is
I need something more,
more than spending every night
in the Winchester.
I want to do more interesting stuff.
I want you to want to want to do it.
Listen to me.
I'm beginning to sound like your mum.
Not that I'd know.
You haven't met his mum?
Not yet.
Don't you get along with your mum?
It's not her...
Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?
No, I love my mum.
I love his mum.
I understand what
you're trying to say and I agree.
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.
I'll book a restaurant.
The place that does all the fish.
Just the two of us.
Things will change. I promise.
Really, Shaun?
Time, gentlemen.
Player two has entered the game.
Haven't you got work?
Player two has left the game.
The front door was open again last night.
I'm not saying it was you.
I know, man.
I'm saying it was Ed.
I can't live like this.
Look at the state of it.
We're not students any more.
Pete...
He brings no money into the house.
He brings a bit.
What? Dealing drugs?
He sells a bit of weed now and again.
You've sold puff.
Yeah, once. At college. To you.
I've known him since primary school.
I like having him around, he's a laugh.
Because he can
impersonate an orang-utan?
Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
Leave him alone.
I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion.
Like that time we stayed up all night drinking
apple schnapps and playing Tekken 2.
When was that?
Five years ago.
When's he going home?
Hey, man, listen... Top left.
I was gonna say... Reload.
I'm on it.
Erm, since... Nice shot!
Two seconds.
All right, Noodle?
Got anything? 
No, man.
Eball says you was holding.
I ain't got nothing.
Nothing at all? 
I've only got an 'enry meself.
All right, laters.
Listen...
since you're not working at the moment
could you please clean up a bit?
And if you play the answer machine,
can you take down everyone's messages?
Yep.
It's not that taxing, is it?
Writing something
on a scrap of paper?
Nope.
Dom, hi...
Come on, it was pretty funny.
Will you do what he said?
I ain't doing nothing for him.
Do it for me, then.
I'm sorry, Shaun.
It's all right.
No, no.
I'm sorry, Shaun.
Oh, my God, that's rotten.
I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
I am not laughing.
Get that.
You get it.
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today
'so can you book the table
for eight rather than seven?
I'll try you at work. Bye, bye.
Hey! You're dead.
Spare some change, please, mister?
Yeah.
Watch out. Are you blind?

Hello, my friend. No beer today?
No, it's a bit early for me.
Gather round, everyone.
Gather round, please.
Gather round.
As well as Mr Sloman being off today
I'm afraid Ash is feeling
a little bit under the weather,
so I will be taking charge as the...
Oldest.
Senior staff member.
So if we can all pull together...
Hello? Hello, mate.
Noel?
I was totally munted last night.
Yeah, I spoke to him. He's only got Henry.
All right, mate. Laters.
Continue.
Thank you.
Erm, as Mr Sloman always says,
there's no I in team but there is an I in pie.
In... There's an I in meat pie.
The anagram of meat is team...
I don't know what he's talking about.
Phones off. It's not a social gathering.
All right, keep your hair on, grandad.
Hey! I'm 29 for Christ's sakes.
How old are you? 20? 21?
Hey, well...
I know you don't wanna be here forever.
I got things I wanna do with my life.
When?
You got red on you.
Hello, mate.
This one comes with
a basic digital package.
You've got your lifestyle channels there,
a bit of Trisha.
Er, you've got entertainment.
I don't know what that is.
News. All the basic, er... news...
channels.
Bizarre events... 
Coming after me... 
I'm with customers.
It's your dad.
He's not my dad,
he's my stepdad.
Philip.
You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?
No.
Your bimonthly visit.
No, I haven't forgotten.
You could bring the flowers
you forgot on Mother's Day.
I was gonna.
And not a cheap posy
from a garage forecourt.
I wasn't gonna.
Well, we look forward to
seeing you tomorrow.
You've got red on you.
I thought it wasn't a social gathering?
How comes you're allowed to
speak to your dad?
A, he's not my dad, OK? He's my stepdad.
And B, it was an emergency.
What, like buying your mum some flowers?
Noel, I do not find it difficult
to keep my work and my social life separate.
Shaun, it's Liz for you.
Hello.
Hello, it's me.
Hello.
Did you get my message? 
Yep.
So it's all OK, then? 
Yep.
'Eight at the place with all the fish?
Cool, that's great. Just ring me later.
Goodbye, Liz.
Bye. Bye, bye, bye.
Liz from Head Office.
It's nothing to panic about.
Sir? Sir?
Sorry. Erm, they're for my mum.
Mum. "To a wonderful Mum"
or "Supermum"?
Er... the first one.
'... London seems
to have gone completely bonkers... '
Oh, my God! Shaun!
Yvonne.
Oooh! How are you doing?
Surviving.
Are you living round here?
Yeah, are you?
Yeah, I just bought a place.
Bought?
I know, bit grown-up, eh?
Are you still with...?
That's great. Glad somebody made it.
How long's that been now?
Er, it's three years ago last week.
Did you do anything special?
We're going out for a meal tonight.
Anywhere nice?
Yeah...
Come on!
Are you gonna thank me, then?
For what?
It doesn't look tidy.
I had a few beers when I finished.
Hello, Fulci's. Can you hold, please? 
Do you want your messages?
Your mum rang about tomorrow night.
Liz rang about the two of you
eating out tonight.
Then your mum rang back to see
if I wanted to eat her out tonight.
Hello, Fulci's.
Hi, I know it's short notice
but could you possibly do me
a table for two for tonight at about eight?
Sorry, we just gave away the last table.
Wasn't true about your mum.
Where are we gonna go?
The Winchester.
Don't be stupid! They don't do food.
There's a Breville out back.
Ed, this is serious!
Hello.
Hello, it's me.
Hello.
What's the plan, then? 
Erm, there's been a bit of a...
a mix-up with the table, babe.
What do you mean? 
They're full up.
But... I thought you said it was all OK? 
Yeah.
You didn't book it, did you, Shaun? 
No.
So... what is the plan, then? 
The Winchester?
Hello? 
Dianne, can you let me in?
I'm not sure, Shaun.
Oh, come on.
Lizzie doesn't want to see you.
Just open the door!
She doesn't want to see you.
Do you want me to climb up the wall,
come through the window? Because I will.
You're not coming in.
OK, see you in a minute.
Don't... 
Hi, it's me again.
Can we just talk about this? Let's go out.
To the Winchester?
Do you want to?
No, I don't fucking want to!
It's not the only place in the world.
We'll go to the Shepherd's,
they do Thai in there.
I'm going out with David and Di.
Let's go together.
You hang out with my friends?
"A failed actress and a twat"?
That's harsh.
I did not call Dianne a failed actress.
Let's just go somewhere and have a laugh.
Things'll be fine, I promise.
You promised you'd stop smoking.
You promised you'd try drinking
red wine instead of beer!
You promised we'd go on holiday.
We went to Greece!
We met in Greece.
At a rave.
It's not the same.
You promised things would change.
You promised us free cable.
I'm working on that.
I can give up smoking whenever I want.
See, don't need them.
W- What was the next one?
It's not enough, Shaun.
'We appear to have
a breakdown in communication there.
Lf you or someone you know may... 
I'd say your nine lives were up, Shaun.
Get fucked, four-eyes!
You go out with her, you love her so much.
What do you mean by that?
'... the devastation really is extensive.
It's a total mess.'
I don't know what he meant by that.
Got you these.
"To a wonderful mum"?
Oooh!
Yeah, that's because...
I thought it would be funny
because of what you said last night
about you don't want to be
It's just a little joke,
just sort of spur of the moment.
They're for your mum, aren't they?
Yeah.
Smooth.
If I don't do something, I'll end up in that pub
for the rest of my life
like those other sad old fuckers
wondering what the hell happened.
What do you mean do something?
Fuck her. You got your pint.
You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?
Oh. You want your favourite monkey?
Shall I do Clyde?
See, I knew you'd get over her.
Who the hell put this on?
It's on random.
For fuck's sake. John, yes please, mate.
You know what we should do tomorrow?
Keep drinking.
A Bloody Mary first thing,
a bite at the King's Head,
couple at The Little Princess,
stagger back here and bang...
back at the bar for shots.
How's that for a slice of fried gold?
No.
Come on, man.
Talk to me.
She said if she stayed with me
she'd end up in here for the rest of her life
like these sad old fuckers
wondering what the hell happened.
That is harsh.
These are rich, interesting characters.
Like who?
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.
He's a bigamist.
Strangled his first wife
with a draught excluder.
And invented the mobile disco.
What about her, then?
Ooh! Cockacidal maniac.
She's an ex-porn star.
They say she starred in
the world's first interracial hardcore loop.
Cafe Au Lait...
Pour Vous.
Yeah. What about John, then?
He's North London Mafia.
It's true, Big Al says so.
Yeah, Big Al also says dogs can't look up.
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanour.
Bernie, the trophy wife.
He's connected.
Why is there a rifle above the bar?
The pub's called the Winchester.
Exactly.
See, you don't need Liz to have a good time.
Don't, man.
No.
Oi, look at me.
Can I just say one thing? I'm not gonna
say there's plenty more fish in the sea,
I'm not gonna say if you love her let her go
and I'm not gonna bombard you with clichés
but what I will say is this...
it's not the end of the world.
Sorry, we're closed.
Pisshead.
What's the matter, love,
haven't you had your tea?
telling my body to come along
Blow!
What? He should say base.
Or freeze.
Don't scratch it! Wait...
That was the second album I ever bought!
It's four in the fucking morning!
It's Saturday!
No, it's not.
and I've got to go to fucking work
in four fucking hours
because every other fucker is fucking ill!
Now can you see why I'm so fucking angry?
Fuck, yeah!
Hey! Pete, look,
I'm sorry, we had a couple of drinks,
we split up with Liz tonight.
Just keep it down, yeah?
Prick.
What was that?
Nothing.
Stop it, we're friends!
He's not my friend. He's a fucking idiot.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means why don't you fuck off!
You wanna live like an animal,
live in the shed, you thick fuck!
Leave him alone!
Stop defending him.
All he ever does is hold you back.
Or is it easier having someone around
who's more of a loser than you?
What's that supposed to mean?
You know what I mean.
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?
Sort your fucking life out, mate.
What's up with your hand, man?
I got mugged on the way home from work.
By who?
Some crackheads. One of them bit me.
I don't know, I didn't stop to ask them!
I've got a splitting headache
and your stupid hip hop isn't helping.
And the front door is open. Again!
It's not hip hop, it's electro. Prick.
Next time I see him, he's dead.
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today
'so can you book the table
for eight rather than seven?
I'll try you at work. Bye, bye.
'Hello, pickle. It's me, Mum.
'Dad mentioned you might be visiting
tomorrow which would be lovely.
'Will you be bringing
Elizabeth with you this time?
'Only we can't wait to meet her finally
'and also I was wondering
if she wanted anything special for lunch?
'Cos these days a lot of people
don't eat meat.'
Do you want anything from the shop?
Cornetto.
Nelson, have you got any papers?
Nelson? I haven't even...
I owe you about 15p.
Oh dear.
Sorry, I haven't got any change.
I didn't even have enough
at the fucking shop. Oh dear.
'... no official comment but religious groups

Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hello.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
She's so drunk.
How much have you had, love?
Oh! I think she likes you.
She wants a cuddle!
I've just come out of a relationship.
Ed, do something!
Wait there.
Two seconds.
I'm really flattered and everything but...
And, hold it there.
Ed! Just get her off me.
Jesus!
What's up with her eyes?
Now, seriously...
Mary, I'm warning you,
I'll have to get physical, I mean it!
This is it... Look, just fuck off!
I think we should go back inside.
Shaun, what's going on?
Shit, it's engaged.
How about an ambulance?
It's engaged, Ed.
Fire engine?
It's one number and it's busy!
And what do you want a fire engine for?
Anything with flashing lights.
Are they still out there?
Yeah. What do you think we should do?
Have a sit-down?
'There are reports of chaos
on the motorways
'as thousands of people
attempt to flee the cities.
The M1, the M3, M4, M6...

'Ln the meantime, contact with

Did you see his head go?
Lf you're confronted... 
We should get out there.
No, we should stay inside.
We can take 'em.
The man said to stay indoors.
Fuck the man.
In here, we're safe.
'... the attackers can be stopped by removing
the head or destroying the brain.
'I'll repeat that, by removing the head
or destroying the brain.'
Hey!
Aim for the head.
Now what?
Get more stuff.
What's in the shed?
Dunno, it's locked.
Why is it locked?
It's always been locked.
No! That's the second album I ever bought!
Some of these are limited...
Ah! What was that?
Blue Monday.
That was an original pressing.
For fuck's sake.
Erm... Purple Rain?
No.
Sign O' The Times?
Definitely not.
The Batman soundtrack?
Throw it.
Dire Straits?
Throw it.
Er... Ooh, Stone Roses?
No.
Second Coming?
I like it.
Ah! Sade?
She dumped you.
I'm going to the shed.
You said it was locked.
Which one do you want? Girl or bloke?
Er... the first one.
'People receiving bites
have experienced headaches and nausea
and developed symptoms... 
You've got red on you.
'Lf you know someone who has been bitten
'it is absolutely essential
that you isolate them immediately.
'The public are being strongly advised
not to approach anyone... '
Pete?
Pete?
Why don't we just go up?
Don't go up there!
Why not?
Because A, he might be one of them
and B, he might still be annoyed.
Pete?
Maybe he went into work.
How come he didn't drive?
His keys are still here.
Maybe he got a lift.
He said he wasn't feeling well. Pete?
Oi, prick!
He's not in.
You got a fag?
No, I've given up.
Since when?
Since...
Come on, babe. Oh, she's engaged.
That was quick.
Ed, this is serious.
Mum! I was gonna call you. Are you OK?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Some men tried to get into the house.
Are they still there?
I'm not sure. We shut the curtains.
Did you try the police?
Well, I thought about it.
Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
No, I'm fine.
Well... they were a bit bitey.
Mum, have you been bitten?
No, but Philip has.
Has she been bitten?
No, Philip has.
Mum, what state is he in?
He's fine. Bit under the weather.
I see.
What's the deal?
We may have to kill my stepdad.
Mum, you're not safe there. I'm coming.
I don't want to cause a fuss.
We're coming to get you, Barbara!
So, what's the plan?
'We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's,
we go in, we take care of Philip.
I'm so sorry, Philip.
'Then we grab Mum, go over to Liz's place,
'hole up, have a cup of tea
and wait for all this to blow over.
Why have we got to go to Liz's?
Because we do.
She dumped you.
I have to know if she's all right.
Because I love her.
All right, gay.
I'm not staying there, though.
Why not?
If we hole up,
I want to be somewhere familiar,
I wanna know where the exits are
and I wanna be allowed to smoke.
'Take Pete's car, go round Mum's,
go in, deal with Philip.
Sorry, Philip.
'Grab mum, go to Liz's,
pick her up, bring her back here,
'have a cup of tea
and wait for all this to blow over.'
Perfik.
No, wait, we can't bring them back here.
Why not?
It's not exactly safe, is it?
Yeah. Look at the state of it.
Where's safe? Where's familiar?
Where can I smoke?
Take car, go to Mum's, kill Phil.
Sorry.
'Grab Liz, go to the Winchester,
'have a nice cold pint
and wait for all this to blow over.'
How's that for a slice of fried gold?
Yeah, boy!
'To recap, it is vital
that you stay in your homes.
'Make no attempt to reach loved ones
'and avoid all physical contact
with the assailants.'
Do you believe everything you hear on TV?
Yeah, I can see it, it's just outside.
Any zombies out there?
Don't say that.
That. The Z word. Don't say it.
Why not?
Because it's ridiculous.
All right. Are there any out there, though?
Can't see any.
Maybe it's not as bad as all that.
Oh! No, there they are.
OK, let's do this, yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah! I got to do a wee first.
Ooh... can I drive?
I always wanted to drive Pete's car.
I might not get another chance.
Ahh! Oh, God.
Sorry, Pete. Listen, we're gonna
borrow your car, OK?
Erm, we'll bring it back.
And if you're feeling better later,
we're... we're going to the pub.
You're more than welcome to, er...
join us.
Pete'd be so pissed off
if he knew I was driving his car.
I don't think so.
Shaun, which button's central locking?
Oh, cock it!
Get lost!
Drive.
'The Church of England
has joined other extremist religious groups
'in proclaiming this
"a sign of a coming apocalypse".
'Downing Street is refusing
to be drawn into a religious debate.
'The bodies of the recently deceased
are returning to life and attacking the living.'
Let's put something else on.
What are you doing? Ed, look out!
I think we hit something.
Or someone.
Ow!
Are you all right?
Come on, let's just go.
Hello?
He's gonna be dead either way.
That's not the point.
Oh, thank God for that.
Ah, hello.
Who's a pretty boy then?
You didn't say Barbara had a Jag.
I've always wanted to drive a Jag.
It's Philip's. He won't let anybody near it.
I put a Mars Bar in it once
and he chased me with a bit of wood.
Fuck, it's gorgeous.
It seems pretty clear, we should go.
Why don't I stay here?
What, what, what, what, what?
You know, just look after the car.
If there's any problems...
I'll honk three times.
Don't forget to kill Philip!
Hello, pickle.
You've got red on you.
Yeah. Mum, is everything OK?
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
Where's Philip?
Dad's in the lounge.
He's not my dad.
Really!
Ed's outside,
we'll take you somewhere safe.
What about the doctor?
I don't think he's gonna come.
Philip won't want to leave the house.
Philip isn't...
Put the kettle on and I'll deal with Philip.
OK, then.
You hungry?
Not really.
I'll make some sandwiches.
No fighting, you two.
'... you may ask where is our God?
'But throughout the land,
men and women of integrity
'rise up to confront the unseen enemy.
'They will not be cowards,
'they will be courageous
in the face of danger.'
I'm so sorry, Philip.
What have you done now?
Nothing.
What have you got there? Flowers, I hope.
No, it's... cricket bat.
Is that for the jumble, Shaun?
No. Yes.
Your toys are upstairs.
I was going to give them to the jumble.
I took them all to the tip, Barbara.
Shaun wants to take us somewhere.
Don't be silly.
Maybe you should stay here
and wait for the doctor.
You said he wasn't coming.
You didn't call the doctor?
Just to be on the safe side.
I'm fine. I ran it under a cold tap.
We had ourjabs when
we went to the Isle of Wight.
But, Philip...
It's overblown nonsense.
A lot of drug nuts running wild.
But I should get Mum away.
I'm not going anywhere without Philip.
Mum, look!
How about that tea?
Mum, how much do you love Philip?
Two sugars, is it?
I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.
Oh, yes. Will you cut me some bread, love?
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?
Do we have to go through all that again?
What would you say if I told you
that Philip's been quite unkind to me?
You weren't easy to live with.
He chased me with a bit of wood!
You did call him a you-know-what.
Did he tell you that? Motherfucker.
Sorry, Mother... Mum!
Did you know that on several occasions...
he touched me?
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have, sorry.
You don't understand...
No, you don't understand.
Philip is my husband
and has been for 17 years
and I would at least expect you
to respect my feelings.
You must be more adult about these things.
Yeah.
Come on, Shaun.
There comes a time when...
you just...
gotta be a man.
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.
Hello, Edward.
Hi, Barbara.
My, how you've grown.
You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?
It wasn't as easy as all that.
Are we following you?
No, it's probably best if we...
Where's the car?
Hmm... I pranged it.
You were parked.
Yeah.
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.
Philip?
Look out!
Christ!
Give me the car keys!
You're not driving that car.
Give me the car keys!
Ed, get Mum in the car.
I'm on it.
Don't worry about me.
Worry about your mother.
Maybe I should drive.
I've adjusted the seat now.
Just be careful!
Can you please turn that noise down?
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?
I'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket.
It is a bit loud.
Sorry, Barbara.
You do realise this is
a 20 mile an hour zone?
Oh, yeah.
Here.
Mum, this won't take a second, all right?
Have you still got the child locks on?
Safety first, Shaun.
You can't...
Hey, man, watch the leather.
Keep moving. If there's any problems...
I'll do the honks.
Hello? 
Hello?
Guys, can you let me in?
What are you doing?
I've come to get you.
What are you doing?
I've come to take you somewhere safe.
We were safe!
You don't know that.
There was two of them out there.
How many are there now?
Lots.
Lots!
It only takes one of them
to know you're in here.
I tried calling but I couldn't get through.
I had to come up with a plan.
Oh, you made a plan?
We have to get out of here.
If we don't, they'll tear us to pieces.
And that will exacerbate things for all of us.
This is not about you and me.
This is about survival.
We need to be somewhere more secure,
somewhere we can stay alive.
We're with you, Shaun.
We're with you.
I'm not going out there.
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces
and if you think about it, neither do you.
I'm not going if Lizzie's not going.
She's going.
I'm not staying by myself.
You're going, aren't you?
Lizzie?
All right, Flash, what's your plan?
Great. I've got a car
but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.
Has anyone got transport?
Yes!
Great. Where?
Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.
I don't see the point
of owning a car in London.
Look, just get any blunt objects together.
If you get cornered,
bash them in the head.
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.
So, what's the plan, then?
We're going to the Winchester.
OK? Let's go.
Come on.
Where's the car?
Apologies for the cramped conditions.
Di, stay on David's lap.
Philip, hang in there, OK?
Ed, get there fast.
Hello.
Ed, be careful.
Is your dad all right?
He's not my dad.
He's bleeding.
I know! Ed, be careful.
Thought you wanted to get there fast?
I want to get there in one piece!
Why are we going this way?
Chill out, it's a short cut.
That road goes to the Winchester.
Liz, please!
I don't understand why the Winchester?
It's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.
They know us.
What makes it so secure?
It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.
And there's a rifle above the bar.
I would think that's deactivated.
It's not. John's connected. Big Al says so.
Big Al also says dogs can't look up.
They can't.
Can't they?
Of course they can!
Are you sure?
Yes! The pub is the right place to go.
Everything is gonna be fine.
I turned it off, all right?
Being a father, it's not easy.
You were 12 when I met you,
you'd already grown up so much.
I just wanted you to be strong
and not give up because you lost your dad.
Philip, you don't have to explain.
No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.
And I always thought
you had it in you to do well.
You just need... m-motivation.
Somebody to look up to and...
I thought it could be me.
Would you just... take care of your mum?
There's a good boy.
Ed, can you pull over?
Two seconds.
Ah! Ed, please pull over.
What for?
Just pull over!
All right.
Whoa, momma!
What the hell are you doing?
Chill out. Everyone's all right.
Stop telling me to chill out!
And everybody is not all right.
What's wrong?
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.
Where's he gone?
Mum, he's dead.
No, he isn't.
Get out!
Jesus!
Get it open!
Ed, get the child locks!
The child lock!
Now what?
We keep moving.
How do we get Philip out the car?
We haven't got time.
We can't leave your dad.
He's not my dad!
Mum, he was, but he's not any more.
I really think we could...
That's not your husband in there. OK?
It looks like him but there is nothing
of the man you loved in that car.
Let's go, shall we?
You're not suggesting we walk?
Everybody OK?
Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.
Maybe we should all hold hands,
make a crocodile?
Do you know where we're going?
David, come on.
Sorry.
Do you, though?
Yeah, totally.
Are we close?
We're pretty close.
Is your mum gonna be OK?
Yeah, I hope so.
Did you contact your folks?
They're in Antigua.
Do you think this is happening there?
I hope not.
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...
You said this wasn't about us.
No, it's not.
You said it was about survival.
You're notjust trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.
Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
Yvonne.
How's it going?
Er, surviving.
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.
Hey, Yvonne.
Erm... this is my boyfriend, Declan.
Erm... my friends Mark, Maggie,
my mum and my cousin Tom.
All right.
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.
They've split up, actually.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
That's a shame.
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?
Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
The pub?
Yeah.
Right, well. Good luck!
Hello.
Hello.
All right.
See? The Winchester's just over there.
Over where?
Over there.
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?
What's the matter, David?
Never taken a short cut before?
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.
Now, the Winchester
is just over that fence, all right?
Everyone stay where they are, I'll...
Are we all here?
One, two, three, four, five. Yes.
There's six of us.
I'm coming!
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
Yes!
No, that's rubbish.
Ooh!
Yes!
Feel free to step in any time.
You did all right.
I didn't want to cramp your style.
I'm so sorry about that.
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.
Is it clear?
No.
How many?
Lots.
Oh, well, that is just great.
There are a fair few of them, yes.
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?
This is hardly constructive, David!
We should have stayed at the flat.
Why didn't you?
Because... Because, because of...
Captain Wow.
Will you stop it?
We'll get nowhere moaning.
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.
Or not.
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face,
it's vacant with a hint of sadness.
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.
Come on!
Urgh.
It's mournful, sorrowful,
you're dead and you hate it. Go.
Uuurgh.
Much better. Ed.
I'll do it on the night.
This is the night!
What about yours?
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?
Don't...
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
One, two, three.
Go, go, go, go.
Shit! Get round me, get round me!
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.
They can hear you.
We do the quiz.
They know.
Stay in character!
I can't see them.
Shaun, we have to get inside.
Break the window.
We'll be exposed!
Break the window!
Is there another way in?
Yeah, there's...
Two seconds. Hey, Noodle.
All right? 
Yeah, man, I can't talk now.
You get anything yet? 
I got nothing.
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.
Oi! What are you doing?
What are you doing? You stupid moron.
Fuck off.
You fuck off!
Fuck fucking off! I've spent an entire life...
Look at me. I've spent my entire life
sticking up for you
and all you ever do is fuck things up
and make me look stupid.
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!
You were saying about another way in?
Yeah, there's a...
What are you doing?
No!
Get inside.
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.
What do you mean do something?
Hello, hello, over here!
Come on, that's it.
Come on, that's it, over here!
Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.
Wait till I've gone then get inside.
Gone where?
I won't be long, I promise. Come on,
you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.
Come on, this way, that's it!
Come on. This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.
Come and get it. It's a running buffet.
All you can eat!
Shall we go in, then?
Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
I think they're for me.
He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
Either way, we need to think about blocking
up this window. We're totally exposed.
How will Shaun get back in?
I'm sure he'll knock.
Let's get some lights on.
David, wait!
Power's off.
That's a good thing.
We mustn't advertise our whereabouts.
No, of course not.
Do we, David?
No, of course not, Lizzie.
I'm just being proactive.
There's no lights, no power.
And there's a hole in the window.
You did that, you twat.
Somebody had to do something!
We were in a spot of bother. Somebody
has to take control of the situation
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility
then perhaps... I should.
Will Shaun be gone long?
He'll be back soon.
How do you know?
I don't think he'd leave us.
Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man
you binned for being unreliable?
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot
is also an impenetrable fortress.
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?
I could get a round in.
Let's just wait for Shaun. We'll barricade
the window when he gets back.
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?
What are we going to eat?
Toasties!
There's a Breville out back.
Great. Saved by nibbles.
Must be why Shaun took us here
before he left.
He's coming back!
Why? Because he promised?
If he does, do you think his master plan
will be anything more than eating peanuts?
Is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's OK?
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.
But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it.
Ed, get me a double vodka.
Right you are.
I'll have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?
Hello.
Right, great, fuck it.
We'll have a party
and get completely smashed.
We've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars.
We got Twiglets. Oh, look, hog lumps.
Pickle!
Hello, Mum. You all right?
Everybody OK?
Yeah.
Any sign of John and Bernie?
No.
Check upstairs?
It's locked.
Phones?
Dead. Same as the power.
Nice of you to join us.
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't I?
How did you lose them?
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn't difficult. They're not all that.
Well, how did you get in?
The back door.
I tried to tell you
before you smashed the window.
But it wasn't me blowing our cover
by arguing with my boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.
Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.
Thanks, babe.
So, what's the plan, then?
Would anyone like a peanut?
Why don't you do your Clyde?
Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?
Ed does the most amazing
impression of the orang-utan.
No, it's not.
It is. Come on. Do it.
No, no.
But it's brilliant. Come on.
You've built it up too much.
No, just do it.
Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Come on, do it.
I'm not a performing monkey.
The power's on.
It's not, I tried it earlier.
The streetlights are on.
I'll flip the fuses, we can watch television.
What about the lights?
Yes. Don't advertise our whereabouts.
The lights are on a separate circuit.
Just flip the mains breakers.
It's quite simple, David.
Liz, erm... have you got a quid?
Erm...
Yeah.
Never anything on, is there?
I think we might have a bit of a problem.
What do you mean?
They followed me.
I thought you said you gave them the slip.
Yeah.
Well, we'll just have to be
extra quiet then, won't we?
Ed, no!
Turn it off!
Where the hell did he come from?
I dunno.
Who put this on?
It's on random.
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.
The jukebox!
Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
What about the rifle?
Cocktails?
What do you mean?
The flaming spirits
Get a rag in, light it.
But the whole place could go up.
What, then?
How about pool?
John, it's time at the bar.
leaping through the sky like a tiger
like Lady Godiva
I can't find the switches!
Then get the fuses!
a supersonic man out of you
cos I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all
Why is Queen still on?
We have a situation!
I know!
Fuck this. Two seconds.
No!
Yes! Yes! In the head!
Ooow!
Ooh, ooh, ooh
good time, good time
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?
Ed, for the last time, it's...
I fucking knew it!
What did I tell you? Big Al was right.
But dogs can look up.
Has anyone fired a gun before?
Oh, yeah.
Apart from Ed?
Apart from David and Ed?
What was Ed's experience?
He shot his sister in the leg.
I think you should do it.
We should all do it.
How can five people operate one gun?
No one has any experience. We've got...
29 bullets.
Call them shells.
29 shells. I need someone
to help me reload,
everyone else to look out. I will fire.
As Bertrand Russell said the only thing
that will redeem mankind is co-operation.
I think we can all appreciate that now.
Was that on a beer mat?
Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.
I won't say anything.
They want to come in.
Get Mum out of the way.
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.
Barbara.
Oh, hello.
Would you like to come with me?
That'd be lovely.
It's nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun's always talking about you.
Really?
Yeah.
Barbara?
Are you all right?
I've got something for you.
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.
I'd like you to have it.
Barbara, Shaun and I have...
It seems only right.
I didn't want to say anything.
I thought Shaun would be worried.
Here they come!
Stay behind me!
There's one!
Sorry, we're closed!
The safety!
That happened to me on stage.
Cock it!
There!
Where?
Three o'clock!
Oh! Over there again. Quarter to twelve.
Keep it simple!
Top left!
Reload.
I'm on it!
Come on, come on.
Nice shot.
OK, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!
Ed, take over a sec.
What is it? What's wrong?
Shaun, I'm so sorry.
Mum, what's wrong?
I didn't want to be a bother.
Mum, what's wrong?
I didn't want to be a bother.
Mum, I don't understand.
The man in his pyjamas.
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.
No, you should've said.
Take over a sec.
What's going on?
What the hell's going on?
Barbara's hurt!
Just take over a minute.
Jesus.
I know first aid.
Just hang on. Mum!
Is she...?
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.
I never thanked you.
For what?
For these. "To a wonderful mum."
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
Oh, no, no! Mum, come on.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Mum. Please don't go.
What are you doing?
We have to deal with her.
For Christ's sake!
She's gonna come back!
She's not going anywhere.
She'll change.
She's my mum!
She's a zombie.
Don't say that.
Move aside. I'm gonna count to three.
One...
two...
three!
Don't point that gun at my mum!
Calm down.
Don't point that gun at Barbara!
Ed, don't exacerbate things!
What's that mean?
This isn't exactly fair.
Here.
Thank you.
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?
Tell him to put the gun down!
She's gonna change. You know I'm right.
And when she does, she'll kill all of us.
That's what your ex can't seem to realise.
That's what this is about, isn't it?
He doesn't like me!
He's always hated me
and now he wants to shoot my mum.
She's not...
You've never thought I was good enough.
We all know you're in love with Liz.
That is not true.
Yes it is!
That is not true.
Yes it is.
I know you only hung out with me
to get close to Liz and when she knocked
you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.
I've come to terms with that, Daffs,
why can't you?
Lizzie, I want you to know
that my feelings for you...
David! There are slightly more
pressing matters at hand here.
Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".
Christ, she's not dead!
She's finished.
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite.
You've gone from
a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.
I'm not a chartered accountant.
Well, you look like one.
Yeah.
I'm a lecturer.
You're a twat.
She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.
Don't say that.
We're not using the Z word.
Please can we just calm the fuck down!
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...
Thank you.
Even if he is being a twat.
Yep.
And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you
but we can't afford to fall apart.
Shaun, babe...
I know you don't wanna hear this...
You do it.
I'm sorry, Mum.
Do it!
Well... I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.
David, no!
Right, I'm leaving.
I'm not staying here.
David, it's suicide.
I think you should go.
We will. We can defend ourselves.
What do you mean "we"?
What do you mean?
Opening that door now
would be a very silly thing to do.
You gonna stay here with him?
Look...
After where he led us?
Let me finish!
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.
Get away from that door this instant!
I'm so sorry, Dianne.
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.
David! No!
No! No! No!
No! No!
Dianne, no!
I'm coming, David!
Oh dear.
Cocktails?
Do it.
Shaun, hold them!
Heads!
Hurry up!
Shauny, look who it is.
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!
I can't hold them!
No!
Pete!
I said leave him alone!
Shaun, bar!
Chuck us a cloth, will you?
Where are the shells?
They're on the bar.
Ow!
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?
The cellar.
Maybe we can get out!
There's a hatch out on to the street.
You mean go back outside?
Oh, give us a fucking break!
Go!
I can see the street.
Come on.
Come on!
Why won't it open?
That's it then, we're trapped.
Hey, let's go to the Winchester!
Whose fucking idea was that?
Man, I've really ballsed this up.
No, you haven't.
I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.
I couldn't save Di or David.
I couldn't even save Mum. I'm useless.
You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried.
You did something, that's what counts.
Yeah, I suppose.
Do you think they'll get through?
Yeah.
How many shells have we got left?
Erm... two.
I suppose we could take a few of them out
if they stand in a line.
I wasn't thinking about them.
I know.
What about Ed? There's only two shells.
I don't mind being eaten.
How are we gonna do this?
I don't know. Erm...
One of us has to go first.
One should do the other
and then do themselves.
You should do me.
I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.
I don't think I've got it in me
to shoot my flatmate,
my mum and my girlfriend
all in the same evening.
What makes you think I've taken you back?
Well...
you don't want to die single, do you?
Actually... I would like to be shot.
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag
since yesterday, I promise.
He hasn't.
Maybe we should have one now.
You left them in my flat.
Yeah, in the bin.
I was desperate.
Sneaky monkey.
Sorry.
I won't say anything.
Come on, we're getting out of here.
I mightjust stay here.
But we can get out.
You two should make a go of it.
What are you talking about?
I only hold you back.
Yeah, but...
Maybe you should have this.
Don't you want it?
No.
I can't hit anything with it anyway,
I'm rubbish.
Ed, I'm sorry.
What for?
Cos I was shouting at you earlier on.
It's all right.
I'm sorry too.
No...
I'm sorry, Shaun.
Oh, God! That's not funny.
I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
I'm not laughing.
You'd better be off.
Bye, Ed. Love you.
Cheers.
I love you too, man.
Ready?
Ready.
Section One. Ready.
Zombies to your front. Fire!
Fire!
Oh, my God! Shaun!
Yvonne?
How are you doing?
Surviving.
They're taking us somewhere safe.
I thought you two might want to tag along.
Is itjust the two of you?
Well, glad somebody made it.
Come on.
'Next, the story of
ten-year-old Enrique Ramírez

'Six months on and, to many, the events

'I don't see nothing wrong with it

'But he's my husband, you know.
I still love him and I got the ring.
You go to bed with it? 
Course I do.
'People can't understand

'Lnitial claims that the virus was caused by
infected monkeys have been dismissed... '
Hello.
What's the plan, then?
Right, a cup of tea...
then we get the Sundays.
Head down the Phoenix for a roast,
veg out in the pub for a bit
then wander home,
watch a bit of telly, go to bed.
Perfik.
I'll get the kettle on.
Can I have two sugars, please?
Ooh! Adventurous.
I might pop into the garden for a bit.
Go on, then.
Two seconds.
Player two has entered the game.
Yes!

I never could get
I never could get

See those leaders
start to frown
It's sword and gun day
Tomorrow never comes
until it's too late
You could be sitting
taking lunch
The news will hit you
like a punch
It's only Tuesday
What time is it?
You never thought
we'd go to war
After all the things
we saw
It's April Fools' day
What time is it?
Tomorrow never comes

Tomorrow never comes

You hear
a whistling overhead
Are you alive

It's only Thursday

A billion candles

Is it your birthday
What time is it?

Nice ride.
It does the job.
What job,
delivering pizzas?
Well, it's not the ride,
it's the rider.
What the hell
was that?
Hey!
You talking to my girl?
Oh, shit. Here we go.
Yeah.
She was just
admiring my ride.
My ride. 
My grandma's Buick
could smoke
that piece of shit,
trailer trash.
Well, what about
your daddy's Viper?
This beast's
got 500 horsepower
and a Borla exhaust system.
It does 0 to 60
in like 4.3 seconds...
That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.
Wow.
You can read the brochure.
What a pitch. I like that.
What's he gonna do?
Let's make it happen.
Bring it.
I got your...
I got your back.
Why don't you nice boys
let your cars do the talking?
I only race
for pink slips.
This car goes for 80 grand.
What would I do with a broken-ass
piece of shit like that?
How about me?
Winner gets me.
Cut it, let's cut it.
Let's go, go, go, go!
Blast-off, baby!
First one out
the other side...
It's time.
Let's go!
Ready, boys? Make it interesting, Clay.
Yeah!
I thought
you loved me.
Oh, well.
What the hell?
Guess I got
a new date for prom.
Clay, stop the car!
Clay, stop the car!
Stop it!
Clay, please stop!
Please stop!
Can I get
a copy of that?
You think
this is a joke, huh?
You see Ken and Barbie
over there?
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.
Mommy and Daddy
are too hooked up.
But I like
screw-ups like you.
You know why?
'Cause you're 100%
guaranteed conviction.
Where's my car?
I crushed it.
You did what?
Sit down! You're done.
Easy, easy.
You're done. You
understand me? You're done.
And all before your eighteenth
birthday. Now sit down.
Sean.
What the hell were
you thinkin', huh?
Mrs. Boswell? Please.
Officer, is it, um,
illegal to smoke in here?
It's a tough state.
a pretty clear-cut case.
He'll be lucky if they don't
try him as an adult.
This is our third town
in two years.
Your son's got two priors
for reckless driving,
willful destruction
of property.
This makes it
strike three.
They're definitely gonna want
to get him off the streets.
Well, there's
just got to be another way.
So, where are we
moving this time?
We are not
moving anywhere.
Sean.
I thought you were
gonna be here on the 7th.
Today is the 7th.
Well, look,
just hold on one second.
Come on in.
You know, Sean, I was,
I was gonna be there.
But your mom,
she said the 7th, see,
and we're a day
ahead of you in Japan.
Well, you're here now,
and that's good.
So, how is your mom?
Where do I sleep?
Now, Sean, you know
she had no other choice.
I mean, it was
either this or juvie hall,
I mean, you just
can't keep moving away
every time
you get into trouble.
Worked for you.
Look, neither of us
asked for this.
But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.
So you just go by the
rules her and I agreed to,
and I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.
Rules?
Yeah, rules. Real simple.
You go to school,
you come back here
right after.
And I don't
want to see or hear
about you
anywhere near a car.
Here,
the bedroom is yours.
Make yourself comfortable.
Lights out in 10.
You got to be kiddin'.
Wrong train.
I'm new here.
Boswell, yes, ma'am.
Japanese food
is like the Army.
Don't ask, don't tell.
Name's Twinkie.
Hey, I noticed
you ain't have a laptop.
Yeah?
I'll hook you up.
Half price.
No, I'm cool.
60% off. Hmm?
Since we're both army
brats and everything.
I ain't got no cash,
an army brat.
All right, all right.
Well, what about
a cell phone, huh?
Everybody needs
a cell phone.
No offense,
but I'm probably
not gonna be here
long enough
to remember your name.
Then you gonna need some new
shoes to book town with, man.
You like Michael Jordan?
I love Michael Jordan.
Check this out.
Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.
LeBron James couldn't even
get his hands on those.
You selling that
Sparco steering wheel?
Hell, no.
That's mine right there.
Man, I even paid
retail for it.
What you drive?
My ride?
Yeah.
My ride's one of a kind.
Show me.
Thought you
weren't stickin' around.
All right.
My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh
My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh
My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh
My life be like
It's times like these
that make me say
Lord if you see me
please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs
for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice
and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip
Slamming, huh?
Look at that car.
Tryin' not to quench your
fire with the things I do
At least let me drive.
Y'all better have some
real cars around here.
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh?
Well, all right.
I don't know if you're
ready for them, though.
You look a little nervous.
What up, Tosh?
I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo
If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go
I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo
If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go
For when you
blow your wad, man.
Hear that?
It's still not right
for the way I drive.
I don't need a computer to tell
me about my throttle response.
Then we're done here.
You wouldn't have
that problem with a V8.
Boys.
All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.
So y'all race
with these things, huh?
Cute little toys.
You know, I almost didn't recognize
you without your slippers on.
Don't you mean uwabaki?
Neela, right?
You're a quick learner.
So, where you from,
anyway?
Here.
No, I mean,
not where you live.
Where'd you come from?
Does it really matter
where I'm from?
Who's the tourist?
What's with you
and the schoolgirls, D?
You're moving up
in the world.
You gotta
elevate your company.
Wednesday, Wednesday,
meet Thursday.
God. Girl.
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?
All right, beautiful.
Hold up.
Hey!
He was just leaving.
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.
Understand that?
We were just talking.
This isn't your scene.
That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,
what does that mean
exactly?
Means, turn around,
keep walking.
That's exactly
what we gonna do.
Come on, man,
let's roll.
Yo, look, man,
he's yakuza.
Now, see, that's funny,
'cause I thought this
was, like, a free country
where a girl could talk
to whoever she wants.
You know who I am,
boy?
Yeah. You're like the Justin
Timberlake of Japan, right?
Leave.
You know yakuza? The Mafia?
Look, sorry, DK- san.
Monkey didn't have
his banana today.
Hey, D, let's go.
It's time to race.
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.
You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.
Then let's race.
With what, huh?
Your skateboard?
Easy to sound cocky
when you got no ride.
Take mine.
Let's race.
What? I wanna see
what the kid's got.
Can he drive?
Can he drive?
You know what DK
stands for?
Donkey Kong?
Drift King.
Drift?
What do you mean,
drift?
Still need
a dictionary?
You know that
real famous painting?
The one of the woman
who's smiling all the time?
The Mona Lisa.
Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.
Well, look, man,
this car right here's
like the Mona Lisa
of the drift world.
Han rebuilt this bad boy
from ground up.
We talking forged pistons,
bigger turbo,
new rods, new crankshaft.
Hey, man, Han's labor
ain't cheap, man, you feel me?
Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift...
All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?
Hand braking
is the easiest,
so the first thing
I want you to do,
I want you
to rip that e-brake.
All right,
after you rip the e-brake,
then I want you
to power over.
You know what?
Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?
All right.
Ready.
Set.
Go!
I told you.
Don't leave town.
Do you know
what time it is?
I thought
it was around 7:00.
You know,
US is a few hours behind.
Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.
Have you been racing, Sean?
You're out of here.
Go ahead.
You don't get it,
do you?
You have
nowhere else to go.
If it doesn't
work out here,
you're going to jail.
Do you get that?
This isn't a game.
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,
if you're gonna
live under my roof,
you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.
Understand?
Understand?
Yes, sir.
Get in.
I'll get you your money.
Why you talking
like you have a choice?
There's a guy in there
with a paw
that owes me some money.
A paw?
Go get me my money.
okane.
Han said, okane.
Let's go.
You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.
I might call you once a week
or once an hour.
I don't care
if you're sick as a dog
or in bed with Beyoncé.
I call, you show.
Only if you teach me
how to drift.
This ain't a negotiation.
I wasn't negotiating.
What's he doing here?
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can
sitting in my garage.
Hope
he's not driving.
When is your next race?
I'd really like to be there.
Why not be in it?
You heard me.
Ready to lose
another car, Han?
I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.
All right.
Put up the '72 Skyline.
Done.
What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?
Get him out of here.
We have business
to discuss.
Your shipment's late.
Since when are you
so worried about the details?
When is
the shipment arriving, Han?
Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.
Hey, Dad, it's me.
Uh, I had to
stay after school
for some
extracurricular activities.
So I'll be home
a little later.
Sir.
You really need to stop
following me around.
What are you
doing here?
I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend
for some drifting lessons.
Trust me.
You don't wanna be
a part of this world.
It's good enough for you.
You don't know
anything about me.
Well, why don't you
think I know?
'Cause I'm a gaijin?
An outsider?
Let me guess.
You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.
Your mama and daddy
was never home.
So you walked around
pissed off all the time.
And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.
Zero for one, cowboy.
Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl
like the rest of
the white guys around here?
Mamacita, oh my God,
I think your on fire
Do you want me
to get you water
Is everything okay
back there?
I can handle DK.
I thought he's yakuza.
His uncle's yakuza.
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.
But I need him.
He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.
What do you mean?
Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action
from everyone
on his turf.
We're on his turf.
50% of something
is better than
100% of nothing.
So have you raced DK?
Why not? Is he that good?
What's the point
of a race?
To see if I'm better
than the other guy.
Just proves you're faster,
that's all.
If I were to race,
it would have to be
for something important.
Or why else do it at all?
Why are you
letting me race?
'Cause you're
DK's kryptonite.
And you owe me a car.
She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down
She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton
She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down
She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton
I make ya smile right
What the...
Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.
You can do
better than 180 k,
they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.
'Cause its just nice you lookin
different sayin' to yourself
You know what?
I'm beginning to like
this country already.
When my chain keep linkin'
like Christmas lights
Mamacita, oh my God
I think your on fire
Do you want me
to get you water
You're looking good.
Disco.
We gotta catch up.
Get you a drink on me, huh?
Let's go.
Aha. Easy now, ladies.
Come on.
Hey Mami, you sexy,
hey Mami, you sexy
How you doing?
Hey, baby.
Hey Mami, you sexy,

Hey Mami, you sexy

He's underage.
Country boys and them boys
in the city
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Disneyland
for grownups, huh?
All these girls, man,
they look like...
What, models?
Check it out.
See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital
on this side of the planet,
all right?
Now, imagine
you been posing all day.
I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.
Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,
you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't
'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.
And most of
the guys around here are
too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.
So what do you do?
Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.
Yeah.
Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.
I tear it up.
Yo.
You should
slow it down papi
You sound like
a carbon copy
Sean!
But you're
just plain sloppy
Hey Mami, you sexy
It's dipset Bitch
There it go
Baby don't stop now
There you go
Damn shorty look good
And I'm thinkin' about
gettin' at her
time to whistle at her
Ay girl,
you make my whistle blow
There it go
Bring it here baby
There it go
Bring it here baby
Top down
It's hot now
and I'm at it to win
You heard me
Who want it with me
Nobody wanna it with me
Oh, I'm so fly
Move it till you feel
something hard on your back
The red Evo's yours.
If u want it come and get it
I ain't kiddin' I'm with it
Here it go, go
So, girl,
let me see you get low
There it go
Yeah, just like that
What do you mean?
You're representing
me now.
What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?
So, girl,
let me see you get low
My mother,
she's blind in one eye
and she can drift
better than that.
where did you find this guy?
Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?
Is that yours?
Sure is.
What happened?
I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.
It's got potential.
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.
You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered. "
You're gonna be late.
Sean!
Come on, man, you broke it.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
There must be
a misunderstanding.
Out of my way,
or you're next.
Take it easy.
Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?
Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!
Touch me again...
Here.
Try not to break
this one.
What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?
Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.
Not easy saving the day,
Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.
You're doing
all right.
Hey.
Yeah?
Sorry about the other night.
Your life isn't
any of my business.
It's okay.
Foul!
Ain't no damn foul.
That was a foul.
Yo, you in my face.
That was a foul.
Hey, Han,
sort this wanker out.
A wanker?
What do I look like,
a zebra?
So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?
Well, you know
those old Westerns
where the cowboys
make a run for the border?
This is my Mexico.
Why'd you let me
race with your car?
You knew
I was gonna wreck it.
Why not?
'Cause it's a lot of money.
I have money.
It's trust and character
I need around me.
You know, who you
choose to be around you
lets you know
who you are.
And one car in exchange
for knowing
what a man's made of,
that's a price
I can live with.
Look at all those
people down there.
They follow the rules,
for what?
They're letting
fear lead them.
What happens if they don't?
Life's simple.
You make choices
and you don't look back.
So,
if you don't drift to win,
what do you drift for?
You really
want to know?
Yeah.
Okay. Let's go.
There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.
Learn by doin' it.
The first drifters
invented drifting
out here in the mountains
by feeling it.
So feel it.
You'll see.
How much you got?
Keep going, keep going.
I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.
Not too early, now.
Go, go, go, go!
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!
Hey, Han.
Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.
Pleasure doing business.
Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?
It's actually not bad.
I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.
See,
I'm not a total gaijin.
I hate that word.
It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.
I thought
you were born here.
Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.
My mom died when I was 10.
She came out here
from Australia
when she
finished high school.
And all I know
about her is that
she went to work
in a hostess bar.
DK's grandmother took me in.
Well, my parents
split up when I was three.
Me and Mom
moved around a lot.
Mostly 'cause of me.
Well,
it was all 'cause of me.
Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,
without even
thinking about it.
But I realize now,
outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.
All that matters is knowing
what you really want
and going after it.
We used to come up here
when we were kids.
Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,
come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.
Things were different
back then.
Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.
Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.
You know, we just made do.
No one bothered us.
The day I got my license
is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.
The day after that,
I won my first race.
I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.
I gotta admit, it felt good.
It felt like...
Like everything else
just disappears.
No past and no future.
No problems.
Just the moment.
Boy needs to chill.
Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?
No. Look, that was
your third set today.
I mean,
them tires ain't cheap.
DK, grab a chair.
We're about to
roast some marshmallows.
Yo, come on, man, look...
Stay away from her,
or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.
Find yourself a new driver.
I'm all right.
What'd you expect?
You didn't just
play with fire,
you soaked
the matches in gasoline.
It's over.
All this over a gaijin?
You've changed, DK.
You say I've changed.
But we're not so different,
you and I.
We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?
They say your mom
was the best trick
in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.
Leave my mother
out of this.
If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,
doing anything
for a buck.
Think anyone would take
a second look at you
if it wasn't
for your uncle?
We're the same, Neela.
Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.
Do you know
who you are?
Do you know
where you belong?
Hey.
Come on.
Hey, brother.
I vouched for you!
Put my reputation
on the line for you!
We were partners!
You think you can keep
your side deals from me?
Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.
This is what we do.
What about now? Hmm?
Is this what we do?
Man, you need me.
You'd still be
shaking down teahouses
for chump change
if it wasn't for me.
Get in!
Go! Go! Go!
Come on.
Sean. Sean!
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.
I'll go with you.
Neela.
See you when
Daddy's not around.
I'm putting you
on a plane tonight.
Sean, don't argue with me.
I can't run away.
Sean,
I'm your father.
I'm responsible
for your well-being.
And I'm responsible
for my mess.
I gotta do this.
Can you understand that?
At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.
You all right, man?
We're leaving town.
Look, I know some people...
I can't do it, Twink.
Look, DK wants your head.
All right?
And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?
You're done here, bro.
Maybe I should
talk to Kamata.
DK answers to him.
I know I just
didn't hear that.
I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
What, are you crazy, huh?
Han is dead, all right!
Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!
It's all I got.
Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.
You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it
out of Kamata's place
alive.
Don't you need it?
No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.
Sean.
You need to leave.
You came to the wrong place.
I didn't come here
to see you.
You think
you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?
I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you
in the first place, sir.
But that's not
why I really came.
I came here
to apologize.
I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.
Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.
How do you plan
to accomplish that?
A race.
DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,
for us.
And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,
once and for all.
We race
and the loser leaves town
for good.
I've already beat
this piece of shit once!
Good.
Then it should be easy.
The cops
took all the cars.
Hey!
That's why she's spitting.
We almost there, Twink.
Couple more tweaks.
It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.
DK picked this road
for a reason.
This is his mountain.
He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Come on.
Yeah! Come on!
Come on, Sean.
Let's go! Let's go!
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.
Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.
Yeah, baby!
That's what
I'm talking about, man.
I told you!
I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo
If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go
Fast and furious
Fast and furious
Hey, yo, Sean!
Yo, Sean!
Hey, check this out, man.
This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.
Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.
Not tonight, Twinkie.
Said he knew Han.
Said Han was family.
All right.
Let's race.
Nice ride.
I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.
I didn't know he was
into American muscle.
He was when
he was rolling with me.
You know this ain't
no 10-second race.
I got nothing but time.
You ready, kid?
Come on, Sean! Come on!
Ready!
Set!
Go!
You so crazy,
you so crazy
Far East to West Mic Check
Cho large
So hot so hard
We cho large!
You so crazy,
you so crazy
So hot so hard
We cho large!
You so crazy,

We got big jewels,

Big watch

Ice cream

You don't understand mammy
We cho large
This that bape shit
Shake it like you ape shit




Here's a great one.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
No, but look at me, all tan.
Why don't you get portraits done
by a professional photographer?
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines.
Yeah, that's great. Next to that,
Chandler won't look so stupid.
Chandler, what do you say?
All right, but I'm not going.
"I'm" going.
The One With The Engagement Picture
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI
Dude, that reverse lay-up.
And how about those three-pointers?
And those guys were this close
to letting us play this time too.
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
You call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him "Hums While He Pees. "
Yes, and we call Ross
Lingers in the Bathroom. 
Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees"
just asked me out.
I thought that guy was married.
He's getting divorced.
Ross, maybe you know him.
It's not a club.
If he's getting a divorce,
is it a good idea to date him?
Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
That's on the napkins at the club.
I gotta go to work.
You don't have to go for a half-hour.
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during lunch.
I could just spread him on a cracker.
Rach, why would you hire this guy?
You know you can't date him, right?
I know that.
We joked that we spend
so much time together...
...he should call me his "work-wife. "
Soon he'll be able to call you "that
lady he knew that got fired. "
I won't get fired, because
I'm not gonna act on it.
You wouldn't mind
if he was dating someone?
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.
Maybe I should open
a divorced men's club.
Dude, that's so sad.
I could put a basketball court
in the back.
Could I play?
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?
I just did them.
Well, drop and give me 10 more.
I had a drink with lunch.
Did those cost reports come in?
I did them last night.
Could you make me 4 copies?
Sure.
Great, thank you.
Hey, Rachel.
Hi, Melissa. What's up?
I'm just about to go out to the store.
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.
Dried fruit and granola,
and stuff like that.
Is Tag here?
No. Why?
I was gonna talk to him about tonight.
Really? You got a little crush
on Tag there, do ya?
We've been flirting back and forth...
...but I was hoping tonight it would
turn into something a little more.
Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.
But you know, I remember him saying
that he had plans tonight.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
All right, back to work.
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?
I don't want to be known as the office
bitch, but I'll call your supervisor.
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.
Now, Chandler, you want to
give us a smile?
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
No, I am.
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Yeah.
Maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else.
Try looking sexy.
Or not.
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?
I got an audition down the street,
and I spilled sauce on my shirt.
You got an extra one?
Yeah, sure.
Here.
Great.
You got anything that's
not Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.
I guess this'll be fine.
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing. Why?
How would you feel about
taking out Tag? I'll pay.
It's gonna take a lot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.
Really? Because I could kind of
use the money.
He's new in town and
he doesn't have any guy friends.
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd appreciate it.
Yeah, okay, no problem.
Thank you.
Ooh, hey, doughnuts!
I know. Let's try a look...
...of far-off wonderment.
Gaze into our future and think about
our marriage and the days to come.
Chandler, what is the matter
with your face?
This picture should say
"Geller and Bing to be married"...
...not "Local woman saves
drowning moron. "
Hey, don't laugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.
Take it, take it!
I like this one.
It seems to say, "I love you and
that's why I have to kill you. "
Can't all be bad.
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.
There it is.
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?
Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull
at that thread?
I'm having a good time.
Me too.
Sorry that guy on the subway
licked your neck.
No, that's okay. He's a friend.
I don't mean to be presumptuous...
...but I have tickets to the
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.
Yeah, l...
Well, I missed the semifinals,
so I think I would just be lost.
I know it's lame, but I got
these tickets from my boss...
Oh, no, no, no, my God!
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
It's my ex-wife, Whitney.
I cannot deal with her now.
She's crazy.
Okay, I know. Hold on.
Hey, Ross.
Yeah.
That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife
out there.
Do you think you could divert her
so we could slip out?
What? No.
Okay, but I have two tickets to
the ballroom-dance finals.
I don't think so, Pheebs.
All right, I'll do it.
But just because you're a friend.
Hi, Ginger.
I want my key back.
I don't have it.
It's right there.
Okay, Sherlock.
I'm sorry, but you'd better go.
I just wanted to thank you
for diverting Kyle's ex.
You're welcome.
We'll talk about it later.
Hi, Whitney.
Hi, Ross.
Are you ready for breakfast?
Yep.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.
Can you give me a second
while I talk to this woman...
...who, by the way, did not
spend the night?
Sure.
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?
Watching ballroom dancing?
Yes, that's where we realized
we were both super cool people.
Look, Kyle just told me
some really bad stuff about her.
Like what?
Like she's really mean, and
she's overly critical and...
She will paint a room a really bright
color without even checking with you.
And she uses sex as a weapon.
Thank you for warning me.
At breakfast, I'll be on alert for
room painting and sex weapons.
You're still gonna go out with her?
Yeah.
Well, didn't you hear
what I just said?
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.
Listen to me, she is crazy!
Your door isn't soundproof.
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.
Morning.
Did you have fun with Joey?
Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.
That's nice.
Then we went to a bar, and he
hooked us up with all these women.
Women? You mean, like old women?
Kind of old, like 30.
I never used to be able
to talk to girls in bars...
...but I got like 20 phone numbers
last night.
That's great.
Joey must have really taught
you some stuff.
A little.
How you doing?
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.
Now pretend I have a camera.
You're changing it.
I can't help it.
You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?
Borrow money from me?
Yeah. Okay, first of all,
you want to make it look spontaneous.
So here's what I do. I look down,
look down, keep looking down.
Then I look up.
See? Now you try.
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a donut.
Hey.
So, I heard you had some fun
with Tag last night.
Yeah, that guy's all right.
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be all "Joey. "
You know, all the women.
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.
That's why I never had
any luck with Chandler.
I'm right here.
Would you mind just not
going out with him again?
Just the idea of you and he
and all these women...
I know he's my assistant,
and we can't date!
But it bothers me, all right?
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.
I got a great partner to pick
up girls with. Finally!
I'm still right here.
Will you talk to him...
...and tell him how unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?
I don't want him to meet anybody
until I'm over my crush.
I will get over it.
It's not like I love him.
It's just physical.
I get these crushes all the time.
I had a crush on you at first.
I know. Monica told me.
Did you have a crush on me
when we first met?
Yeah, sure.
Can you people not see me?
Will you talk to him?
I don't know, Rach.
I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.
One.
No, 10. You said 10.
You can't take that back.
You wanted to talk to me?
I don't know.
You got something for me?
Yeah, this is from Rachel.
Ten. Okay.
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.
Really?
Yeah, for you.
Hey, there you are.
There I am.
You okay?
Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.
So he gave me an antihistamine.
I fell asleep on the subway
and went to Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is far.
What were you thinking?
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.
Okay, see. Look down.
Look down.
Look down.
Chandler?
Yeah?
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?
FYI, she must have shown Kyle
over 30 paint samples...
...before she painted that room.
And his response to each one was,
I don't give a tiny rat's ass. 
Maybe she should have spent
a little less time decorating...
...and a little more time
in the bedroom.
I don't think we are going
to have that problem...
...but maybe it's because I am not
emotionally unavailable.
You think he's
emotionally unavailable?
I think he can be.
Maybe he wouldn't be...
...if she didn't bring the office
home every night.
Excuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her life.
Well, she certainly knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
I knew you were going
to throw that in my face!
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.
What more do you want?!
We want the last 6 years back!
So do we! So do we!
I'm sorry you had to see that.
Morning, Rachel.
Hey, so, what'd you do last night?
Went out with Joey.
Yeah?
Another night of bird-dogging
the chicas?
No, we had a really good talk.
I don't think I'll do
the bar scene anymore.
Wow, I did not see that coming.
It's just not really who I am.
I've always been happier when...
Why am I telling you this?
You don't care about this stuff.
Yes, I do.
You were saying,
I'm happier when I... . 
When I'm in a relationship.
I love having a girlfriend.
Really?
Someone I can spoil, you know.
Spoil?
Let me ask you something.
Do you believe there's one perfect
person for everyone?
I'm starting to.
And if that person's in your life
you should do something about it?
Yes. Hell, yes.
All right, then, it's settled.
I'm getting back together with my ex.
I would love to!
Hello?
Oh. This is gonna be a while.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
My God!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?
And speaking of being selfish in bed,
how's Whitney?
Maybe she wouldn't have to be
selfish in bed...
...if someone else knew where
everything was.
Oh, he knows.
For the most part.
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.
We kind of need to talk.
Both of you together?
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
to pick up a few things...
...and we got to reminiscing.
We talked most of the night...
...and realized the reason
we're angry with each other...
...is because there are still
feelings there.
So... .
Oh, just say it, Kyle!
We're gonna try again.
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?
I'll work on that.
Right, because you're so
capable of change.
You know, he hums when he pees.
I do know.
Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
I'm sorry.
Pheebs, you were right about her.
You know, she did try to use
sex as a weapon.
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
You know, he hums while he does
other stuff too.
We're better off without them.
Even if they break up again, you better
not let him in your sad men's club.
Divorced men's club.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.
Hey, guys, check it out.
My mom sent me the paper.
Let's see it.
Oh, yeah, that looks good.
You make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, we look great together.
We really do.


"Bates is the world's
most expensive form
of contraception."
Hey.
What kind of talk is that?
The girls at the other colleges
we been to, they just put out?
Oh, my god.
It's pretty, huh?
Yeah.
Two to go.
Colby up.
Dad, how come
you didn't finish college?
Well, i had that
semester and a half
at seton hall.
Yeah, and?
Your grandma and grandpa
didn't stress college.
They were
working- class people.
How come your parents
were anti- education?
They weren't anti.
You can't lay it
all off on them.
I got into
a little trouble
when i was a kid.
I heard.
You did?
While in waterville,
dine at the stone house,
serving the freshest
maine lobster since 1840.
Come see our new salad bar,
featuring a wonderful--
are you
in the mafia?
Am i in the what?
Whatever you wanna call it.
Organized crime.
That's total crap.
Who told you that?
Dad, i've lived in the house
all my life.
I've seen police come with
warrants. I've seen you going
out at 3:00 in the morning.
You never seen doc cusamano
go out at 3:00 in the morning
on a call?
Did the cusamano kids ever find
$50, 000 in krugerrands...
and a. 45 automatic while they
were hunting for easter eggs?
I'm in the waste management
business. Everybody immediately
assumes you're mobbed- up.
It's a stereotype,
and it's offensive.
And you're the last person
i would want to perpetuate it.
Fine.
There is no mafia.
All right, look.
Med, you're a grown woman,
almost.
Some of my money...
comes from illegal gambling
and wha-- and whatnot.
How does that make you feel?
At least you don't keep
denying it, like mom.
Kids in school think
it's actually kind of neat.
They seen
the godfather, right?
Not really. Casinowe like.
Sharon stone,
'70s clothes, pills.
I'm not askin' about those bums.
I'm askin' about you.
Sometimes i wish
you were like other dads.
Then, like mr. Scangarelo,
for example.
An advertising executive
for big tobacco.
Or lawyers? Ugh.
So many dads are full of shit.
And i'm not?
You finally told
the truth about this.
Look, med,
part of my income comes
from legitimate businesses.
Stock market, i--
look, dad, please. Okay?
Don't start
mealy- mouthing.
How's my sweetheart?
I'm so pissed
i can hardly see.
Why? You gettin' the flu?
No, it's my cousin, svetlana.
The amputee?
Two months
she's only in america,
and she's already
getting married.
You knew the deal. I got
two kids high school age.
We talked about this.
Yes, and a wife
whenever you want.
What do i have in my life?
Boy, am i glad i called.
Fuck you, then! Hang up!
How are the whirlpool jets?
They get'em in right?
Don't throw up in my face
things you buy me, okay?
Her prosthetic leg
fell off in a gap store,
and he carries her out
like a knight...
in white satin armor.
I gotta go.
Uh, my daughter's comin'.
Jesus.
Yeah. How ya feelin'?
Oh, better, actually.
Fever just broke.
I miss you two.
How's the interviews
going?
Good.
Real good.
Oh, yeah?
Did she like bates?
Anything to get her
off of this berkeley kick.
What the fuck?
Tony?
Yeah, yeah.
Look, i'll call you back
from the motel.
Meadow! Come on!
Come on.
Get in.
Okay, okay!
What's the rush?
Geez, dad!
What's going on?
I think i saw
an old friend, that's all.
You know that guy
at the gas station?
Maybe not.
Probably not.
Then what?
Dad, slow down!
Dad, jesus,
what's with you?
It's all right.
What's going on? -
just foolin' around.
Dad-- colby. Turn.
Colby. Turn left.
It's to the left!
Left!
See? That's'cause you're
talkin' to me so much.
Hey, this gets us
toward colby anyhow.
Dad, that's our motel.
Hello. Our motel's
right there.
Do you know that guy?
Nah. It wasn't him.
Take this number down
and call me back.
Now? It's pourin' down here.
Mmm. Bonjour.
Room service
et arrivee.
Oop.
Why, thank you,
kind sir.
What? You said
poached eggs. -
you're not gonna eat'em now,
after all that work.
I guess my eyes
were bigger
than my stomach.
Anthony, why don't you
go over to jason's,
play nintendo?
Nope. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No kisses. Cooties.
I'll be back
in, like, an hour.
Oh, motherfucker.
A real fuckin' shit.
Hey. I'm not sure,
but i think i just saw
fabian petrulio.
Refresh my memory.
Was he before your time?
Made guy. Flipped about
ten years ago when he
got busted for peddlin' "h."
took out a lot of people,
a lot of people from our outfit.
My old man was sick.
He never recovered
when he heard the news.
You saw this guy?
That's what i'm sayin'.
but i'm not sure.
Up in maine? What the fuck?
He went into
the witness protection program.
Then they kicked him out.
Now he goes to colleges and
gets paid all kinds of money...
to talk about what
a big, bad mafioso he was.
Piece of shit.
Febbie and me partied
a couple of times,
but jackie aprile
knew him good.
They did a couple of counts
together up in lewisburg.
You know that bust that was
in his rec room of sinatra?
Febbie made it for him
in a prison workshop.
That was frank, that bust?
I always thought
it was shaquille.
Fucker needs to practice
a little on lips.
Yeah, i know. Anyway,
run these plates for me.
Go ahead.
Maine,
Call you back tonight
at 10:00. all right?
Hey.
What's wrong
with the phone in your room?
Nothin'. Takin' a walk,
saw the phone. Figured i'd
give christopher a call.
Oh, yeah?
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. They got a leak
in the roof, though.
Is that all right?
Who is it?
Father phil.
Just a second.
Oh, jesus.
Oh, my god.
Look at you!
I hope i'm not
barging in.
Oh, no, i was,
uh, watching tv.
Oh. I was over
at the clothing drive,
and i thought
you were up in maine.
By the way,
your marchino
pedal pusher suit,
flew out of there.
Oh, good, good, good.
So anyway, jean cusamano
said you were ill.
Yes, i was. The flu
that was going around?
Yipes.
Yeah. I still have
a little fever, but, uh--
i also have
a confession
to make, carm.
i- i have a jones
for your baked ziti.
Sure. Any time.
I have some in the freezer.
I can reheat it.
It's so much better that way,
isn't it? The mozzarella
gets all nice and chewy.
I like that too.
I was having
a little fernet.
Yeah.
Settles the system.
Would you like something?
Some wine, if it's open.
So, how's med and
tony's trip going?
I should know? He doesn't have
time to talk to me for two
lousy minutes.
Oh, geez.
Dad, stop staring.
Why are you doing that?
It's an exciting time.
I can't tell you
how proud i am of you.
A real student at casa soprano.
And she looks like
one of the models right out
of italianvogue.
Italian, italian, italian.
Thank you.
You're definitely
up to something.
Oof! How'd you get
so cynical?
we talked about before.
How's that sittin' with you?
Like i wasn't 90% sure
already.
What about your brother?
Does he know?
I think so.
There was a time
when the italian people...
didn't have
a lot of options.
You mean like mario cuomo?
Sorry.
You know, i put food
on the table.
My father was in it.
My uncle was in it.
Maybe i was too lazy
to think for myself--
consider myself a...rebel.
Maybe being a rebel in my family
would have been sellin'
patio furniture on route 22.
In college,
nothing interested you?
Nah, i barely got in.
Well,
kind of liked history.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Napoleon,
the roman empire.
The potsdam conference--
that kind of thing.
What's the potsdam conference?
Pots- damned if i know now.
Oh, my god.
Dad, i have something
to tell you.
Yeah?
You're not--
no! Jesus!
A couple of weeks ago,
me and some friends,
we were doing speed.
We did kind of a lot
of it for a while.
You what?
It was just between
homework and sats...
and just general
pressure of life.
We needed something
to keep going.
That crap'll kill you.
I know.
I oughta slap the shit outta
you. Where did you get it?
If i thought
this was gonna be a lecture,
i never would have told you.
Take a reality check. What do
you think i'm gonna say?
Where did you get it?
No way i'm telling you,
especially after this reaction.
Why did you tell me?
You were honest with me today.
I won't be doing it again.
It got too scary.
Jesus, right under my nose.
You think you'd know.
No, dad, you won't.
I'm glad you told me,
in spite of everything.
I'm glad i did too.
I'm glad we have
that kind of relationship.
Tony hates
building fires.
We have
this beautiful fireplace,
and those same three logs...
have been in there
since lincoln split them.
Fear of fire.
Good deterrent
to keep out of hell.
Maybe there is hope for him.
Oh. I got something for you.
That's what
we were talking about.
The chapter on buddhism
is spectacular,
but i don't want you going
over to those zany zennies.
Fat chance. It's funny.
I could never just sit on
the floor and think of nothing.
Thank you.
Sure.
You'll see how islam
has gotten a bad rap
in current culture, and--
boy, this chianti, though,
is beyond reproach.
Word up.
Thought you fell in.
This is carrie
and lucinda.
How ya doin'?
They go to colby.
Yeah? Why don't you
hang out with them?
What better way to learn
about the college?
Yeah, maybe, but--
no, no,
that'd be cool.
Please excuse him.
No, really.
We love to dish
the school.
Well--
go ahead.
Now, med,
no drinkin'.
Girls, you see
that she sticks
to cokes.
I'll come back for you
in an hour and a half.
Be good.
Yo.
What do you got?
Wet shoes.
You chose this life.
You don't want
to work in the rain,
try out for the yankees.
The car is registered
to fredrick peters,
38 washington street,
waterville, maine.
It's off route 201.
I looked it up.
Fredrick peters.
Fabian petrulio.
Good match, huh?
I guess. I don't know.
T, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I got meadow here.
Jesus.
Fuckin' nightmare. You want,
i'll fly up and take care of it.
You're a good kid.
You stay put.
Maybe call pussy or paulie.
What, they can do it,
Don't be sensitive. They had
a friend, jimmy, die in prison
on account of this scumbag.
All right, i'll let'em know.
Fuck, i gotta do my homework
and positively i. D. This guy.
I thought you said it was him.
I haven't seen him in
12 years. I gotta make sure.
All right, i'll call you
around midnight. Sit tight.
You think
i'm a schnorrer,
don't you?
A who?
It means somebody
who always shows up
in time for free grub.
Well, you're here a lot.
And you're a man.
You like to eat.
I can't get over you
with that yiddish.
my neighborhood
in yonkers was mixed.
Jewish and italian,
you know?
Eh, a heady brew.
What does that mean,
"heady"?
Mmm. Melting pot.
Some vigor.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm calling for tony soprano.
Cajun stuffed olives?
Who can i say
is calling?
This is dr. Melfi.
His nurse?
No. Is--
is this mrs. Soprano?
Uh, that's right.
And you are again?
Jennifer melfi.
Dr. Melfi?
Jennifer.
Lovely name.
No, he's not home.
Could i impose
on you to, uh,
to tell him that
i need to reschedule
monday's appointment.
I'm down with the flu.
Does he have your number?
Let me give it to you in case.
I lost my pencil, up his ass.
I'll tell him
you called.
Why does he have to lie?
Why couldn't he tell me
his therapist is a woman?
What is he hiding?
Maybe he did tell you, and you
didn't hear him clearly.
Oh, please.
Here's your fernet.
Why wouldn't he tell me,
unless he's screwing her.
Carmela, please.
And i thought
he was changing.
I thought therapy was gonna
clear up the fuckin' freak show
in his head.
Carmela. I'm sure
you're wrong about them.
Therapy is a start.
It's a good start,
but, yes, it doesn't
fix the soul.
He's gonna need help
from other sources
to repair that.
Well, then you
talk to him.
You help him.
But, well,
there you go.
W- will he listen?
He must be
a very unhappy man.
He's unhappy!
Sleep is my number one--
aw, shit.
Why go into it?
Good thing
it's full of air bubbles.
Mommy?
Yes, bear?
Would you put me to bed?
I'm scared.
Sure, honey. Hold on.
I thought
she was sleeping.
Yeah, well, she woke up.
Daddy's gonna come too,
sweetie.
We'll both
put you to bed.
Hurry, daddy.
Yeah, yeah.
These red pepper flakes
really make all the difference.
Good as willem dafoe was,
i cannot picture
that jesus looked like him.
Could you
pass the cheese?
Not that he didn't do
a good job, willem dafoe,
but the story's
confusing.
So he gets down
offthe cross?
You know, originally,
bobby d. Was supposed
to have that role?
Really?
Oof.
Different picture.
Oh, totally.
You talkin' to me, pilate?
You must be talkin' to me,
'cause i don't see nobody else
here, except barabbas here.
You know
what's remarkable?
If you take everything
jesus ever said,
add it up, it only amounts
to two hours of talk.
No.
No, but wait.
I heard the same thing
about the beatles.
Except it was
if you add up all their songs,
it only comes to ten hours.
Yes.
Of course, it wasn't
just what christ said.
It was his deeds.
See, that's my question.
I understand what he did,
but a lot of what he said,
i don't get.
Like,"the sun rises on the just
and the unjust alike"?
Because. Christ was
saying that we're all--
that whores will go to heaven
before a lot of the righteous?
not right.
Let's face it, father.
We got some major
contradictions here.
It's about love.
Think about it like that.
What does that mean?
It means,
hopefully, someday,
we will learn to tolerate,
accept and forgive
those that are different.
Change through love.
Well.
Well-- oh, man,
i better get going.
Where you going?
You just got here.
It's getting late.
But it's pourin' rain out.
And i know
you love that dvd player.
I gotremains of the day.
See?
Do i know you?
Anything with
emma thompson, i'm there.
Father phil,
i didn't know you looked.
To take in through the eyes
a beautiful woman?
Is that so different
than a sunset, a douglas fir,
or any of god's
handiwork?
Hey, fred.
Hey, tanky.
What do you say?
You gonna give away
any homemade cheese
this year?
For what they get
for cream, i don't know.
Listen, tank,
anybody been lookin'
for me...
or askin'
any questions
about me?
New york sounding?
Is there a problem?
No, no. Nah, dipshit
hit me with his boat while
i was tubin' on caribou lake.
Claims it was
my fault.
If he shows up,
you want me
to give you a call?
Yeah, i wouldn't mind.
Do that. Thanks.
You ready?
Yeah. Let's go.
No one was asking
for you, fred.
All right, vitus.
Hello, rat.
Please leave me alone,
miss kenton.
Why won't you
show me your book?
This is my private time.
You're invading it.
Oh, is that so?
Yes.
your private time, am i?
Yes.
What's in that book?
Come on. Let me see.
Or are you protecting me?
Is that what you're doing?
Would i be shocked?
Would it ruin
my character?
Let me see it.
Father, turn it off.
I can't handle it.
Oh, father,
i'm a terrible person.
Oh, no.
You're a wonderful woman.
Oh, it's been
building in me.
I need to get it out.
There's so much in me,
i wanna-- i wanna--
carmela,
if i can help.
Please.
How?
How long has it been
since you last confessed?
if you like,
i can do this with you.
You mean right here,
father? Now?
The whole world
is god's house.
He hears and sees
everything.
Forgive me, father,
for i have sinned.
It has been four weeks
since my last confess--
what am i
talkin' about?
That's a lie.
I haven't
truly confessed
in tw- twenty years.
Go on.
I have forsaken...
what is right...
for what is easy,
allowing what
i know is evil
in my house;
allowing my children--
oh, my god,
my sweet children--
to be a part of it...
because i
wanted things
for them.
Wanted a better life,
good schools.
I wanted this house.
Wanted money in my hands--
money to buy anything
i ever wanted.
I'm so ashamed.
I think he has committed
hor- horrible acts.
I think he has-- you know
all about him, father phil.
I'm the same.
I've said nothing.
I've done nothing about it.
I got a bad feeling.
It's just a matter of time
before god compensates me...
with outrage
for my sins.
All right, come on.
Oh, tequila breath.
Whew!
Sorry, dad.
It's all right, kiddo.
Just hang onto me.
Don't throw up
on that dress,
or i'll have to tell
your mother everything.
This guy was giving me
tequila shooters.
Oh-- oh, god,
everything is spinning.
You're not mad,
are you, daddy?
Little bit.
Where are the keys?
I gave them to you.
i love you, dad.
I know.
You must
truly repent,
genuinely
and honestly.
And in the future,
you must renounce
all these actions,
and then god
will absolve you.
I don't know, father.
I'll try.
But i still love him.
I still believe
he can be a good man.
Then you help change him
into a better man,
and then you will have
done good in god's eyes.
I think you should
take communion.
Yeah.
Why do you
have that with you?
Unfortunately i had
to say mass for someone
in intensive care.
Lord, i am not worthy
to receive thee.
But just say the word,
and i will be healed.
And i will
be healed.
the body of christ.
It was broken
for you.
the blood of christ.
It was shed for you.
Accept the spirit of christ,
our lord and savior.
Amen.
In the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit.
Amen.
I booked a seat on
a boston flight, tomorrow, 4:00.
Best i could get.
Don't come.
I'll make sure you
and meadow clear the state
before anything happens.
We don't ever meet
face to face.
I am your soldier, antonio.
This is my duty, like we're
always talkin' about.
The way this went down,
this is my call.
I gotta vouch
for this myself.
Clippin' a famous rat
would put me a cunt hair away
from bein' made.
He might have recognized me
at the gas station.
He could lam anytime.
You stay put.
End of discussion.
Why are you using
the pay phone again?
These walls are
like paper. I didn't
want to wake you up.
Dad, please don't lie
to me.
Let's go back
to bed.
Lying down
made me throw up.
Hello.
Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, good.
Oh, you-- you wanna
sleep over there?
Okay. Love you.
That was a. J.
He's sleepin' over.
Oh, i see.
He's at
a friend's house.
The pucillos.
I don't know
if you know them.
No, i--
oh.
Oh-- oh, i--
what?
Are you all right?
Father phil?
Are you
all right?
Hello.
Hello?
Ow! Don't!
Wanna stop and get
a beer? Huh?
No?
I'll pick you up
in a little while.
You knock'em dead.
Aren't you coming in?
No, i left my watch
at the motel.
I'll catch up
to you later.
Grab me a student paper.
You should have
some coffee.
yep.
We didn't
do anything
out of line?
There's nothing
to apologize about.
That's right.
I should
get dressed,
get goin'.
Anthony junior
will be home soon.
Oh, my god. My car's
been out there all night
in plain sight.
If we didn't do anything wrong,
we didn't do anything wrong.
Is there a commandment
against eating ziti?
It's okay.
Take a shower,
get dressed.
Don't forget
your sacrament kit,
whatever.
I'm home!
Carmela.
I don't know
where to begin.
It's-- it's not
that i don't have desire
for you in my heart.
Marrone, father, please.
But last night...
was one of
the most difficult tests
from god ever for me.
What are you
talkin' about?
We're friends.
What's that look about?
What, i look some way?
I was just thinkin'
about when we watched
casablancalast week.
That new print
is great, huh?
You know when bogie says,
"of all the lousy gin joints
in the world, why'd she
have to pick mine?"
Of all thefinukpriests
in the world,
why did i have to get
the one who's straight?
Carmela--
come on. It's a joke.
I would have done it
myself last night,
but some people came along.
But anyway,
it's a gray town car, new model.
You pick'em up
on the colby campus.
Stay on'em.
Where on
the colby campus?
His kid's applyin'.
The fuckin' admissions office.
You follow'em.
An hour outta town,
you pull up alongside--
boom! Twelve- gauge.
Do what i ask,
or you'll never get
another bag off me.
No, no. Fuck that.
You want the cops
to find out who burnt down
the historical house?
Fuck you,
fuck- wad!
We were volunteer firemen
together, asshole! I know!
Yeah, is dougy in?
Good mornin', rat.
Who are you?
Don't make me laugh.
You pimp! You fuck!
Teddy, there must be
something we can do--
tony. It's tony, you fuck.
You know how much trouble
you're in now? You took
an oath, and you broke it!
I could've
killed you last night,
outside the motel.
Your daughter was drunk,
remember? I was there
in the parking lot.
but i didn't do it.
Because of her,
i told myself,
"it's just a coincidence.
He's takin'
his little girl to college."
One thing about us wiseguys,
the hustle never ends.
You shot me at that motel,
your life would've been
flushed down thepiscia- do!
Please, tony, i'm begging!
Jimmy says hello
from hell, you fuck!
Where have you been?
I went back
to the motel,
they didn't have the watch.
So i went to the restaurant.
They was closed. I had
to wait for them to open.
Restaurant had your watch?
I took it off in the bathroom
when i was washing my hands.
You ready?
Don't wanna be late
for bowdoin.
Dad, what's up with that?
the restaurant.
I tried the back door.
There were puddles.
It was dumb.
I know.
Your hand is bleeding.
Dad, where did you go?
You saw that man, didn't you?
I cut it on a screen door.
The man you said
you didn't know.
Ah, va a napoli.
What do you think
happened?
I don't know.
You got in a fight?
You don't know.
You're makin'
a big deal outta this,
and you don't know.
You were on the pay phone
again last night
at 1:00 in the morning.
I was on the pay phone
at 1:00 in the morning?
Excuse me,
miss cuervo anejo.
You can't be trusted to remember
what happened last night, 'cause
you were seeing pink elephants.
I warned you not to drink.
Dad, you're being honest
with me, right?
Pretty soon here
you're gonna start
hurtin' my feelings.
We have that kind
of relationship, you said.
That's right.
We do or we don't.
Takes two to tango.
what?
Nothing.
I love you.
I love you too.
Where's my paper?
I forgot.
She forgot.
Miss soprano,
come on in.
Shall we talk
about your future?
Oh, here they are,
the two ivy leaguers.
Mwah! How was it?
Do you's want something to eat?
It was good.
I gotta call hunter.
Hey.
Gee, she spared me
no boring detail.
I'll be back.
What a trip.
I'm beat.
What, new england?
It's so gorgeous.
Hmm. You still sound
a little nasal,
but you look better.
Any cold pasta?
There was some ziti,
but it all got eaten.
The whole tray?
From last sunday?
Monsignor jughead was here.
If you are referring
to father intintola,
yes, he was.
He spent
the night here.
Yeah, right.
The priest spent the night
here. What happened?
Nothing.
Where was anthony?
He was sleeping over
at jason's.
The priest spent the night here,
nothin' happened, and you're
tellin' me this because--
you might hear something,
take it the wrong way.
His car was out front all night.
You know what?
This is too fucked up
for me even to think about.
What'd you guys do
for 12 hours? Play,
uh,"name that pope"?
He gave me
communion.
Oh, i'll bet
he gave you communion.
Excuse me?
The guy spends the night
here with you, and all
he does is slip you a wafer?
That's verging on sacrilege.
Oh, i didn't mean to verge.
You think i'm lying?
I don't know,
but the whole thing sounds--
would i have told you about it
voluntarily if there had been
anything to be ashamed of?
Do i look like
the friggin' thornbird
over here?
He's a fag. That's it.
'Cause otherwise,
i gotta question
what i'm hearin' here.
Oh, tony, you are a sketch.
Oh, by the way,
your therapist called.
Jennifer?
Carm.

around Lincoln,
but 685 is looking jim-dandy
in both directions.
More traffic reports on the five,
but coming up,
beautiful Kimberly
with complete Accu-Weather...
of the quiet life
we'll never know
for the runaway bus
for the things you've never done
and life is cruel
this town called malice
of disused milk floats
to their hearts
letters on the line to dry
make you stop believing
fast and furious
year after year
a fine blend of ice
in a town called malice
The cool Porsche.
You keep staring at it.
Why don't you shoo?
I don't want to shoo.
Your mother tell you
never to talk to strangers?
She's over there,
and she says I should talk to you.
She did?
Yeah.
She wants to know
what you're doing here.
I think she thinks
you're cute.
I don't know anything
about that car.
And I'm only interested
in your mother
if she lost 20 pounds
and 30 years,
so I'd really like it
if you got the fuck away from me.
Whatever.
Yeah, whatever. Goodbye. Scadoodle.
See ya, wouldn't want to be ya.
Smell ya, shouldn't have to tell ya.
Bean.
You're up early.
Thunder woke me up.
I wanted to see you
before you left.
I'm gonna miss that.
Me too.
I'm gonna miss everything.
It's only two nights.
With this weather
and our luck,
it scares me.
Honey, you know
I gotta go.
But I'm coming home
to you in two days.
With really good news,
I promise.
Ooh!
Are you sure you have time?
Maybe not for dinner
and a movie, but...
Tree!
Still horny?
to Salt Lake City has been delayed...
I'm so sorry, Phil.
No, it's fine.
Is Bean all right?
Oh, yeah, the fire department's
over there.
Our crazy neighbors,
the tyrannists...
She's fine, really.
She practically forced me
to get over here.
She knows what
this job means, right?
She knows somebody
has to pay for a new kitchen.
Now be betterjust make
this flight, huh?
Yeah, we will.
I mean, we have to.
Hope the weather's
better in Mexico.
Mr. Noble,
how are you today?
Oouldn't be better.
But, more importantly,
how are you...
...Genevive?
Buenas tardes.
Deme una margarita,
por favor.
Con mucha sal.
Gracias.
My business is my pleasure.
How ya doin'?
I'm a nervous wreck.
Think positive.
I think that I'm sweating
through my suit.
Getting some culture?
Indeed.
Isn't she a tad pubescent?
Even for you?
I'd make an exception for her.
Did you study the assignment?
No, I shredded it.
Then I humped the bellboy
on the room service cart.
Adios.
I hate these Oatholic countries.
All blushy-blushy. No sucky-fucky.
you'll find your way.
Now, look, there's
been a change of plans.
The portfolio has to be delivered
sooner than we discussed.
What are you saying?
She's leaving for Europe tomorrow.
I'm not a fucking magician.
Just get it done today.
I almost forgot!
Yeah?
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday?
What can I say, the guy...
even need to think about it!
That's good, right?
Yes, I think so.
Dos margaritas, por favor.
You know, I think we did it.
I don't know what
you were freaking out about.
You were remarkable.
No, you were.
No, you. It was you!
No way they can't
give us this job.
You really think that?
I know.
Good!
Yeah!
Shh. We need two more.
went to Mexico
to tell his love
still the lady knew
was dreaming of
Yeah?
Andy, you crazy limey bastard, it's me!
Who?
Julian!
Who?
J-Julian Noble from Portugal.
Remember?
Who?
Julian Noble.
Yeah. I just thought
I'd give you a chat.
See how you're doing.
It's my birthday.
Andy? Hello?
Yeah, hello.
Is Oindy there?
Now, this smells like a party!
Margarita, por favor.
Well, you look like
you could use one.
Who couldn't?
I've had, uh...
Four, five, maybe. I don't know...
They're darn tasty.
Margaritas always
taste better in Mexico.
They certainly do.
Margaritas and cock.
Gracias. And one
for my friend over there.
Oh, no, no! That's...
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to make a pass at you.
I'm not worried.
If you're that type of guy...
I don't mean to be rude but...
It's all right.
I'm just messin' with ya.
I'm sorry about
the cock comment.
Kind of a conversation stopper.
Yeah.
So? What are you
doing in Mexico?
Tell me something, uh...
Danny Wright.
Garrison & Wright.
Tell me something,
Danny Wright.
Yes, sir.
Why the hell do you care
why I'm in Mexico?
Why so interested, huh?
No reason. Just...
...hotel bar conversation, I guess.
Are you with the farm?
The agency?
Are you following me?
No, no.
Did I make you?
I have no idea
what you're talk...
Did I fucking make you? Hm?
OK. I'm going to excuse myself.
I have to go, thank you.
No. No, please.
No, I'm really tired.
No, no, please.
I didn't mean to weird you out.
I just get paranoid sometimes.
I was wrong. Please.
I'm drunk. I'm tired.
I've been fornicating
for the last two hours,
and, before that,
I was doing shit...
Horrible business shit...
Please... come on.
I was out of order.
Let's finish our drink.
Oome on.
Here you go.
Here you are.
Here's your drink.
Here you go.
I mean, you seem
like a nice guy.
You know, a normal guy.
I'm sorry.
Really, it's all right.
So...
...you in town on business?
You have that way
about you, Danny.
Why are you so interested?
Very good.
Yeah?
Ah, very good.
Oh, I'm here on business.
Is it going well?
Very well, I hope.
My... my partner and I...
He's upstairs.
...we just had
a very good pitch session.
No shit?
Very good.
Well, that's fantastic.
That's great, Danny.
I needed a day like this.
I hear ya.
I've had a tough couple years.
I was with this business
out of Denver for nine years.
And out of the blue they just...
They laid me off.
Yeah. Just like that.
And it was, I don't know,
two and a half years ago.
I've been struggling back ever since.
And today you got back.
Well, I hope.
Today you're a man again.
Yeah.
And to be a man,
after they fuck you
and destroy your self-respect...
Well, that is a great thing.
Thank you.
Dos margaritas, por favor.
Are you married, Danny?
Oh, yeah, I am.
Fourteen years.
Oh... let me guess.
High school sweetheart.
It's true.
Unbelievable.
The fuckin' American dream, huh?
Yeah. What about you?
What do you do for a living?
You got kids, Danny?
Oh, no.
I crossed the line.
No, no, no. You did not.
You did not cross the line.
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
We lost our son three years ago.
It was a school bus accident.
Fourteen children lived that day...
...and one died.
That was Henry.
We, uh...
...had a bad run for a while.
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.
One's a midget, and the other's got
a dick 15 inches long.
W-what are you saying?
I'm trying to change the subject.
The midget says to the bartender,
"They call my amigo
the human swizzle stick.
You know what they
call me?"
This is incredible.
You're... very rude.
I'm trying to change the subject.
Thank you very much
for the drink.
Goodbye. Good night.
Thank you.
Don't you wanna hear the punchline?
It's a fucking good one.
Gracias.
you can't dig nothin'
or are you just talkin'?
You sure you don't want to switch?
No, no, get outta here.
You're the one with the kids.
You're the one with the tree.
You wanna flip another coin?
Somebody's gotta stay for now.
I'll call you the minute I hear.
Oall me sooner.
Oh, God.
My cell phone.
I think I left it at the front desk.
Watch my stuff for a sec?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
I couldn't help but overhear.
Yeah. So you're spying
on my personal conversations
now, huh? Great.
Something about the asshole buyers
not being completely convinced.
And now wanted to hear
other pitches?
Sorry about that.
I-I knew things
were too good to be true anyway.
I'm sorry about the circumstances,
but I'm glad you're still in town.
It gives me the opportunity to tell you
how truly embarrassed I am
about last night.
See? See, the thing is...
I liked you.
I kind of enjoyed
talking to someone, you know,
just... talking.
Really?
Yeah.
And yet...
I tell you about my dead son,
and you mock it.
I lost my wife.
I was 24 years old,
I was drunk,
I plowed our car
into an oak tree.
Jesus.
Since then, I've soiled
my way through life,
been a magnificently cold moron.
I run away from anything
that resembles an emotion.
Thus, you tell me
about your dead son,
I tell you a joke
about a 15-inch schlong.
So you can forgive me, huh?
Better I remember it now
than somewhere over Amarillo.
All right.
Speak to you mañana, right?
Yeah, yeah.
It's gonna be all right.
I know.
Hey, Danny.
Wait. Hey.
I've got an extra ticket to
the bullfights this afternoon.
Supposed to be a good one.
It would mean a great deal
to me if you would join me.
Oh, I'm so...
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you,
I can't. I have work.
On a Sunday afternoon?
Ever seen a bullfight?
No.
You haven't seen the real Mexico Oity
until you've seen a bullfight.
Oome on.
Olél
Olél
Olél
Olél Olél
Bean is not gonna believe this.
I can't wait to tell her.
ever find a woman like that?
A woman you can share
everything with.
She's pretty special.
You must be too.
I could learn from you.
You want my mortgage,
my blood pressure?
I've never had
my blood pressure taken,
and I wouldn't know
how to get a mortgage
for all the teenage twat
in Thailand.
You don't own a house?
No house.
No apartment, no address.
You bullshittin' me?
I shit you not. Montecristo?
Uh... yeah!
You don't have a permanent address?
Where do you live?
I live wherever I'm working.
So, what do you do, Julian?
What do you possibly do you don't have
a permanent home or an address?
I'd rather not say.
Oh, my God,
did you see that?
Jeez, it's so bloody.
We're lucky.
That matador was very good.
It's much worse
when they're mediocre.
A great matador,
he can kill the bull with
one plunge of the blade.
A lesser one,
he's going to have to
plunge that blade
more than once.
That makes the crowd
very unhappy.
They don't like to see
the bull suffer.
No.
No, no. They clearly care
so very much about these animals.
They respect these beasts.
They want 'em to die with honor.
That's ridiculous.
There's no honor in being killed
by a man with a sword
whether it's one plunge or 20.
Ah, you're wrong.
You're very wrong.
There is honor.
How would you know?
I do.
You're a mysterious man, Julian.
It's... confidential.
Oonfidential?
What, do you work
for the government?
The government?
Pfff! Please.
You know what they pay?
Hmph! Forget it.
Watch the picadors.
You a spy? Something like that?
You read too many novels, Danny.
Huh? You a spy?
So now you're not going
to tell me. It's OK.
All right.
Hm. All right.
If I tell you,
will you keep your cool?
What do you mean?
We're in public,
and I don't want you
to lose your shit.
Lose my shit?
My God, w-what
are you gonna tell me?
Sometimes...
Sometimes what?
Sometimes...
...people need to be eliminated.
Oh, come on!
What? You're...
You're a hit man?
Oh, please.
Please. My handler...
...calls me a facilitator.
A facilitator of fatalities.
That's insane.
Think what you like.
I gotta hand it to ya, Julian,
you're one of the best bullshit artists
I've met, and I've met some.
You're absolutely right, Danny.
My name is Earl Johnson.
I sell aluminum siding
in Minneapolis.
You actually kill people for a living?
I do what I'm asked to do.
What makes sense to me.
For like, the Mob?
I tend to be hired
on the more kind of
anonymous high-paying jobs.
Oorporate gigs.
Oorporate gigs?
I'm a great helper
in getting deals closed.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe in the Easter Bunny.
I don't believe you.
Oome on! Oorporate gigs.
Think what you will.
Ridiculous.
Yes!
Oorporate gigs.
Yes! My God...
I knew there was a reason
I never told anyone what I did.
All right, see that guy over there?
Fat man and little girl?
Yeah.
Say I wanted him dead.
I want him dead, his family dead.
Dead. Right now.
Right here.
Right now? Oouldn't happen.
I know, but say that it could.
Money's no object.
You sure you wanna know?
Yeah.
Yeah, you sure?
Yeah.
I want you to facilitate it.
All right, come with me.
Let's go.
Olél
Olél
Olél
I'm a big fan of the gotta-pee theory
of assassinations.
Gotta pee?
Everyone's gotta pee.
Now...
...ask me for a cigarette.
Do it.
Oan I have a cigarette, please?
Sure. But these things'll
Now, look around.
They're scary.
Yes and no.
They seem more interested
in the beautiful women
coming and going
from the ladies' room.
That's good for us.
Just like those men over there
at the concession stand.
They're only interested in us
if they see us walking over
with our wallets open.
No one is watching
the men's room.
The gotta-pee theory.
You're catching on.
Now, escape routes.
Escape routes?
Don't wanna get caught, right?
Don't get caught, it sucks.
See the main exit?
Yeah.
That's a traffic jam.
Where else?
You tell me.
Uh, that door over there.
If it... if it weren't locked.
Vietnamese girl I once knew
had her legs so locked together
I couldn't get a whiff
of her spring roll.
Two drinks, half a Quaalude later,
I was at an all-you-can eat buffet.
Every lock can be broken.
It's just a matter of will
and whether it's worth it.
This looks like it's worth it.
Why are we buying the cigarettes?
'Oause I wanna smoke.
Gracias.
Oome over here.
Now do your shoelaces up.
What time's our flight
to Florida, Seymour?
I think 2:00, Derrick.
Let's go, Seymour.
Holy shit!
You ready?
Ready for what?
You wanted to see
what I do, right?
Yes.
Yes, I've been watching.
But, you know...
What? Show-and-tell is over.
The real deal is about to start.
The real deal?
Show-and-tell is for sissies.
But a sissy I'm not.
Oome on!
My God, fire!
Oome on. It's a distraction.
Are you crazy?
Fire or tits, either one will
distract most cops.
Are you ready to finish
what we started?
That was extremely dangerous.
You proved your point.
Baloney! Baloney!
The cops may have
gone towards the fire,
but his bodyguard probably stood firm.
Bodyguard?
If I'm asked to kill,
they have a bodyguard.
If they didn't, they'd ask you.
So I slit the guard's throat
in one move,
push him into the bathroom...
And now we're set up for the kill.
Where the hell
did you get the knife?
He's not peeing,
so it must be number dos.
OK, joke's over.
Point made, Julian.
Not yet. Not yet.
Point made.
The point's made.
Let's get out of here...
Don't fuckin' ruin things,
OK? Don't do it.
OK. Julian?
I'm asking you to stop this!
No way, job's not done.
But this is not a job!
You said money was no object!
This is want you wanted?
No!
You helped me.
I didn't help you!
Oh, yes, you did!
Oh, yes, you did!
No! No, no.
Oh, God, no!
Oh! Disculpa me, por favor.
Lo siento.
That was incredible!
You scared the hell out of me!
You liked that. You did?
I really bought it!
What, that I'd stab a stranger?
Just like that?
A complete stranger?
Well, yes!
Yes, I did.
I'm not psychotic.
No, I know.
Psychopathic, not psychotic.
I don't think you're a psychopath.
Well, I kill people. Doesn't that
seem a wee bit psychopathic?
Well, yeah, but...
Don't get the wrong impression.
Because we share a laugh
doesn't mean I'm not unsavory.
No, what you do is unsavory.
You know what they say.
You are what you do.
Gracias.
Gracias.
Tell me...
...will Bean stay with you if
this job doesn't come through?
Will Bean stay with you
if you continue this losing streak
without any end?
If she ever left me
I'd fall apart...
You're not answering my question.
To be quite honest...
...I don't know how much faith
the woman has left in her.
Hey.
Oomforting me?
Hey.
Let's change the subject. Please.
I agree.
Something sunnier.
Sunnier.
Absolutely.
There's something
I wanted to talk about.
It's a favor, really.
Sure.
A big favor.
No, it's OK.
See, the thing is...
...I could use your help.
Help in what?
I'm down here,
I finished my otherjob early,
so I let it be known.
You let it be known?
Yeah, to the powers that be,
that I was available.
The powers that be?
Yeah.
Anyway, they called me up.
An urgent thing. Has to happen today.
An-anotherjob?
Jesus Ohrist.
The thing is, I could
really use your help.
You're kidding right now.
I'm as serious
as an erection problem.
I mean, I...
Gracias.
I can't help you, Julian.
You could.
Well, I could, but I-I can't,
I'm not gonna help
kill an innocent man.
Who says he's innocent?
This is ridiculous.
No!
You'd just have to...
No, no, no, no!
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.
You're being childish.
Ooga-shacka, ooga-shacka...
Not listening.
Ohildish.
You're being childish.
All I'm asking you...
All right. All right.
I won't tell you.
Good.
Won't mention it.
Great.
I won't say that
all you have to do
is trip on the street.
I can't believe you just said that.
Just trip in half an hour
so his bodyguards look the other way.
No way.
Fifty thousand dollars
is what I could pay you.
No.
A lot of money. Oash.
It could be interesting and fun.
I said no.
He's a prick, a real prick!
I don't give a darn
who he is or what he did
or anything like that.
I'm not gonna help you, Julian.
I'm not gonna do that.
And if you bring it up again,
I'll... I'll leave.
Fine.
Fine.
Ohange the subject.
Good. You do it.
Ohange it.
You.
Fine.
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cheerleader.
Really. A cheerleader.
Yeah. I wanted to be thrown in the air
and march in the band.
Seriously?
That's so funny.
I've got a brother-in-law
who was a male cheerleader...
Jesus Ohrist, Danny!
I don't want to
talk about cheerleaders
unless I talk about getting in
a shower with them!
I want to talk about what I wanted to,
which you don't want to!
There's nothing
to talk about!
Well, then,
it was nice knowing you.
Oh, come...
Now, Julian...
Oome on, what are you...
You're leaving?
I've got business to attend to.
I really thought...
Nothing.
Think nothing. Just consider me the best
cocktail party story you ever met.
Bye, Danny.
Julian!
I was right.
I finally got in touch with Alejandra
and she said her bosses are
leaning towards Cardenas
and his group,
and not us.
Now, things still might
break in our favor.
I mean, their first instinct
was to go with us,
but they're getting intense pressure
to sign with a Mexican company.
I'm trying to get Antonio
so I can set up
one more meeting
with you guys tomorrow.
I'll call you
when I hear something.
So hang in there.
It's not over yet.
Danny, it's Julian.
Oome on, Danny,
I just want to say I'm sorry.
I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up.
But... I'm sorry.
I'm a mess! I'm a fucker! Ha!
have asked you to help me.
I infringed...
I infringed on your kindness,
but please...
...let me tell you I'm sorry.
Let me apologize.
Oan't you see
how guilty I feel?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yes.
to be loved by anyone
to have fun with anyone
hanging about
to see me cry
to go out at any time
it's such a crime
wanna be loved by anyone
It happens every day
Hello, Julian.
Getting some culture?
Anytime I can.
You look tired.
I need a break.
What are you saying, Julian?
Moscow, Las Vegas,
Vienna, the Philippines.
Now Budapest. I'm exhausted.
Well, you know what it's like.
You take a break,
we go with a younger, cheaper kid.
He does all right.
Maybe we don't want you back when
you're ready to get back in the game.
You'll always want me.
No, not always.
Not if we can save a few dollars.
Not if it gets sloppy again,
like in Manila.
That was one time.
Made some people nervous.
It made me nervous.
Well, that's why
I need a break.
I don't want to have
that happen again.
I know, that's what I'm saying.
But I'm feeling burnt-out,
I'm feeling...
Oan you believe this shit?
I mean, can you believe
the words coming out of my mouth?
Did you ever think
you'd live to see the day?
I never thought you'd
live to see the day.
There's not a retirement home
for assassins, is there?
Archery at four, riflery at five?
A little early-bird dinner at six?
Goddamn it, you leave the game,
even for a while,
I don't know if they'll
let you back in.
And then what
are you gonna do?
Waste days picking up
illiterate teenagers
for suck-and-fuck sessions
behind the Old Navy store?
Sounds delightful to me.
Julian, do this job.
If you don't, you're going to regret it,
I promise you.
How do you know?
Just do it, Julian.
Please, do it. OK?
We have a problem, Mr. Randy.
The problem is Julian Noble.
Seems he didn't
deliver the portfolio.
You know...
...it says it took 53 years
to paint this ceiling.
People are upset, Mr. Randy.
Mr. Stick is upset.
Mr. Stick knows?
Mr. Stick knows.
Well, he knows we can fix it.
I'm just the messenger.
But he knows we can fix it.
We always fix any problems.
You can't fix it with Noble.
Ladies.
All right. I'll replace him.
No.
Yes, you'll replace him,
but no.
Mr. Stick has asked
for other things.
No, it's ridiculous.
Julian has been
with us for 22 years.
Two little mistakes...
Julian Noble... is a dead man.
Oh, that's it, Danny boy!
Oh, yeah!
Give it to me,
Danny boy!
Danny boy! Oh! Uh!
Oh! Excellent.
Laundry's done.
Tomorrow's four years.
I know.
It's such a long time, really,
when you think about it.
Seems like yesterday, right?
Henry was alive...
...here.
When I was first in high school,
I told you they made fun of me.
And they called me Hippo Hips
and Plate of Beans, the works.
And even though I did basketball
and... and chorus and...
And I had a few friends
and I acted strong...
...I never was.
Because I believed them always,
every last cruel word.
I always thought
I would believe them.
Until I met you.
You arrived in 12th grade...
...and you told me
that I was pretty.
And for the first time,
I believed it.
You told me that I was sexy.
You were sexy back there
on the dryer.
And when Henry died...
to stay strong...
...and that we would
get through it.
And we did.
We did.
It's because you
never gave up on me.
I never could.
I never will.
Who could that be
at 11:30 at night?
Yeah?
Yes. Who's there?
Danny with the large white fanny!
Julian!
Would you mind opening up, Danny?
It's freezing out here!
My balls are like bonbons!
I was praying
you'd remember me.
It's been a spell.
Please, please, come on...
Oome on in.
Thank you, thank you.
Oooh!
Hey.
Oh, I decided to...
How did you find me?
I found a whore
with a heart of gold once.
I can find Danny Wright's card
in my address book.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't realize. Sorry.
You must be Bean.
My wife.
My boots.
I've heard so much about you.
And me, you.
There's no doubt you're every bit
as lovely as Danny said.
I always said you were
the luckiest man I ever met.
Well...
What are you doing here, Julian?
I really don't know.
I don't know.
I hope it's all right, my being here.
I mean...
I guess it's the middle
Yes, it's...
Well...
I could sure use some coffee.
Yes. All right.
Of course.
I could get coffee.
That'd be great.
Or some whiskey?
Even better.
Tonight's a night for whiskey, then.
And song and dance.
Well, whiskey, at least.
This is really odd.
Really, really odd.
I could ask him to leave.
We just asked him to stay.
We could change our minds.
Why? Do you think he's dangerous?
He's an assassin, Bean.
Of course he's dangerous.
But I mean "dangerous" dangerous.
You said he was a nice guy.
He is. For an assassin,
he's... very nice.
What? I'm allowed to curse.
Especially now.
If not now, when?
True.
This is the fucking perfect time
to be fucking cursing.
There's a fucking killer
standing in our
fucking living room.
Do you think he
would show me his gun?
To a stranger,
arriving in
the middle of the night.
Well, you're not a stranger.
Well, I'm pretty strange.
Be that as it may,
you're not a stranger, Julian.
Far from it.
The toast really
should be to you, Danny.
And to you, Bean.
For your hospitality
and your warmth.
I never thought
I'd see you again, Julian.
I never thought
I'd see you again, Danny.
But, well...
Things change.
They just change.
You saved it.
You saved it.
I can't believe it.
No, it's...
It touches me
that you kept it.
How could I not?
That was a special day.
Yes.
So Danny told you what I did?
Professionally?
Did you bring your gun?
Yes... as a matter of fact.
May I see it?
Really?
Yes, please.
Honey, he's notjust...
Here you go.
Yes, it is.
You know your guns, Bean.
Yes, well...
My God.
You are a magnificent woman.
Bean knows a lot of things
about a lot of things.
Bean, tell me,
did Danny tell you everything
about our time
in Mexico together?
Yes, I'm sure. Why?
My God, you look great, Danny.
You do too, Julian.
Oh, no.
I look like a Bangkok hooker
on a Sunday morning
after the Navy left town.
But you...
Life's been good to you,
am I right?
Pretty good, yeah.
Your work? You have that respect
you wanted back again?
I do.
So you got thatjob
you were in Mexico for?
We did.
And your luck?
It's better, right?
No more trees in the kitchen?
You told him about that?
And you love Bean
more than ever.
Mm. That I do.
Then what more could you want?
Here's a toast.
To a man with respect again,
to a woman who's more lovely
than any man deserves
and to me.
What is the toast to you for?
Toast to a dead man, Bean.
Toast to a dead man.
I had this job in Manila.
Now, normally,
this would make me happy.
I like the hot climate.
The guys look like chicks.
The thing was,
I was burnt-out.
I didn't know it, didn't even know
what "burnt-out" meant at the time.
But I was.
I was a classic textbook case.
I was completely
losing control of myself.
I tried to counter this
with booze, of course,
but nothing was working.
I drank and drank and...
...nothing.
I was still feeling edgy,
still feeling like
my head was going to explode.
So...
...I moved on
to my other usual diversions.
A wonderful little
whorehouse I knew
right off of Mabini Street.
But that wasn't workin'either.
And a good fuck usually does.
Excuse my French.
Go on.
So I had this assignment.
Nothing special,
some copper wire executive,
someone doesn't
want him around.
You know,
my usual type gig.
Well, I knew that this copper wire guy
always came to this sweaty little
outdoor market every Thursday
to buy fruit.
The guy liked his fruit.
It was a simple plan.
As he walks through the crowds
I bump into him
The thing was,
I was still a mess.
And every time I looked at the guy,
I didn't see him,
but I saw a little boy insteadl
And it wasn't just any boy.
It was me.
Me, as a child!
It was freaky shit, right?
Real nervous breakdown sort of stuff.
Still readied the knife,
still prepared for thejob.
...I couldn't do it.
I just couldn't do it.
Then what happened?
I woke up in a pile
of donkey shit.
I fainted.
And I guess I landed
in a pile of donkey shit.
And since then,
it's been extremely
hot and cold.
Some jobs go OK,
others not so OK.
And then a few weeks ago
I fucked up again. In Budapest.
Froze.
Right at the moment
I should have been firing.
And that was that.
And now it's just a matter of time.
Well, isn't there somebody
that you can talk to?
Like Mary Beth
in Human Resources?
Oome on, this is...
this is insane.
They're gonna kill you
for botching a job?
Well, can't you just,
you know, say to them,
you know, "You know what? I'm sorry.
You know,
I was a little burned out,
and I'm a little messed up."
I mean, can't you do that?
I mean, you were seeing images
of yourself as a small boy.
If that's not a Freudian meltdown,
I don't know what is.
But certainly,
they have to see that.
No, they don't.
They don't.
I mean, I...
I'd be dead if my handler
hadn't risked his life
and tipped me off to the plans.
I barely got out of Budapest alive.
And how did you end up here?
In Denver?
Some people run home
in a time of crisis.
My problem,
the problem I shared
with Danny in Mexico,
is that I don't have a home.
I mean...
...that's why I'm here.
You're the only friend I have.
Oh, well, that's...
that's ridiculous.
I... You have... you have friends.
I don't.
I really don't.
You all right?
You're my only friend,
and I barely know you.
This home...
...your home...
...it's the only home I know.
She's lovely.
You said that to me in Mexico.
And I nodded and listened...
...but now I see.
I see.
You were right.
You told her everything
that happened in Mexico?
I told her about
our time together, yes.
And where does that story end?
She knows the last I heard of you
you were knocking on my room
in the middle of the night
asking forgiveness for trying
to involve me in a job.
That's what you said?
That I knocked and knocked.
And you never answered?
Yes.
I'm a bit drunk.
That's a nice place to be.
Julian, you will stay
the night, of course?
Oh, thank you, Bean.
I promise I'll be
out of here tomorrow.
Oh, let's not talk about that now.
You know, I don't think
I've been up with a guest
till 2:30 in the morning
in a long time.
It's good, right?
Oh, it's very good.
Hey...
Oan I turn on your stereo?
Sure. Now?
Yeah, I saw this old record of yours,
and I just wanted to hear In the Wee
Small Hours of the Morning. You know?
Since we're in the wee small hours
of the morning?
Oertainly. I guess.
I hope you approve, but...
...I would really like
to ask your wife to dance.
Julian, you have had
too much to drink.
Bean.
Please, may I have this dance?
Bravo! Bravo!
I learned to dance in a South American
jail by a chap named Morales.
Well, that's another story,
another time.
The final nightcap.
I can't think about the headache
I'm gonna have.
Then don't. Or do.
Take three aspirins and a raw egg
before you go to bed.
Where'd you hear that one?
The Assassin's Book of Home Remedies?
The only woman I ever loved.
My mother.
What about your wife?
My wife?
Danny told me that you were married
and that she died in a car accident.
You loved her.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this!
I was never married.
I can't believe this!
No car accident?
No. I'd been insensitive
to Danny about your son
and was trying to win him over.
It was stupid.
You know what,
I'm the one that was stupid.
No, no, no, no, no!
You're not stupid.
I'm a prick! Me, not you!
The thing is, I could have
kept lying to you now,
but I chose not to,
as a sign of respect.
Because... well, now we're friends.
We are friends, aren't we?
So, what other bullshit
did you pour over me?
Yeah, are you even
a hit man, Julian?
Yeah, a facility fatalitator,
whatever the fuck you call yourself.
Yes, I am.
And to answer your question,
Danny, I lie when I need to,
tell the truth when I can.
With you...
...it's mostly been the truth.
Shall I go?
No.
No.
No...
Aren't we fucking cosmopolitan?
Having a trained assassin
stay over the night.
Letting heartbreaking lies
just roll over us
like the summer breeze.
Next we shall be
wife swapping. Ha!
You don't have a wife.
Remember?
That's a good point.
No. I don't like chicken.
Oome on.
I've gotta talk to you.
What is it, Julian?
What do you want?
We can't talk about it here.
Oome on.
we're in your rent-a-car.
The thing is, Danny...
...the thing I didn't tell you,
the thing that I omitted
because Bean was present,
was that I've been offered a way
out of my fatal predicament.
Well, that's good.
I know, I know.
No, that's really good.
My handler, Mr. Randy,
contacted me like he always does
with an ad in the International Tribune
looking for cat-sitters in Bali.
Is that how you stay in contact?
Oat-sitter ads?
Yeah.
OK, you know,
this is ridiculous.
I'm so tired, Julian.
Well, anyway,
he contacted me four days ago
and basically said
he'd been to the higher-ups
and got me a reprieve.
Well, like I said, that's...
that's... great news.
The thing is...
...he's asked me
to do one more job.
I have no choice.
It's do the job or else.
And that brings us
to the dirty little problem.
All right.
What's the problem?
It's a pretty big problem,
and you're really not gonna like it.
I'm not gonna like it?
Not at all.
Because the job...
...involves you.
You're not saying
what I think you're saying.
What do you think I'm saying?
You know what
I think you're saying.
No. I don't think I know
what you think I'm saying.
Does somebody want me dead?
No.
No one wants you dead, Danny.
Jesus!
No. No...
You were doing that...
But I need your help
in facilitating a fatality.
I need your help.
No, no, no.
My help is exactly what you don't need.
I'm a mess, Danny, you know that.
I'm a complete mess.
I don't know
if I can do this job by myself.
You gotta talk
to somebody else, a colleague.
I don't know colleagues.
You must!
I don't.
Well, I can't help you.
I know you're not
the ideal candidate...
No. I'm far, far from ideal, Julian.
Remember my reaction the last time
you proposed something this asinine?
That was Mexico.
I was trying to show you a good time!
Oh, so now killing somebody
is a good time?
Oan be.
Oh... I'm going to sleep.
Danny, come on.
You don't even need
a second person.
Haven't you done these things yourself?
Some jobs are better
with two men.
I think it's better
if the second man isn't scared shitless,
and... and unprepared.
And unqualified and uninterested!
Now I'm gonna go to bed.
I'm in a very dangerous position here.
I'm in no shape to try this myself.
An assassin without confidence
is a horrible thing.
It's like a relief pitcher
who fumbles the ball.
Tell me you know you mixed
two sports in your metaphor.
Huh? I can't do that.
Yeah.
Danny! Danny, please!
I need your help!
Someone's gonna die,
a stranger or me.
Which would you rather? Hm?
Look,
if I can do the job successfully,
I'm free and clear.
Free and clear, Danny!
I have enough money to retire
to a beautiful Greek island
with beautiful Greeks.
Heaven awaits me, Danny,
if you and I do this job.
You're my only friend!
Oh, Julian.
It's true!
And what?
You owe me.
If this were to happen,
when would it take place?
Today. The horse races.
Today?
Yeah, Arizona.
No, that couldn't happen.
Sorry, no choice.
Today is the four-year anniversary
of my son Henry's death.
We go to the cemetery.
That's what we do.
What time does
the cemetery close, Danny?
Well, I-I don't know.
We'll have you back at 4:30,
flowers in hand. I promise.
You'll do that? OK.
How will you do that, Julian?
Well, we have a 7:40 plane reservation
to Tucson this morning.
Plenty of time
to catch the 2:30 back.
We do?
I made it yesterday.
First class. Real fancy.
Now, chop-chop.
Upstairs. Get dressed.
Make a story up to Bean.
We've gotta get
this road on the show. Eh?
to be so bad to you
that I would never do
and I would fall from grace
right from my face
when we used to dance?
from circumstance
We were young
songs unsung
of the moment
your heart meant
what your heart meant
I did it, I leaned against that.
I was yawning,
and I apologize. I just...
Ah. Turn it off!
Sorry.
Bingo.
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Julian!
Hey. Julian!
Julian!
Julian!
Julian?
Hey.
What... what the hell
is going on?
Julian!
You drag me out to Arizona,
to the goddamn horse races.
To do this job, right?
To do this job,
this one lastjob.
To kill somebody
that I don't even know
so that you can live out
the rest of your life with Greeks...
Beautiful little Greeks, Danny!
We do... I do everything perfectly.
Not you, me. Perfectly.
Did you see me, Julian?
I was brilliant!
You get a clean shot.
You had a clean shot,
and you don't take it?
What's going on?
I've lost it, Danny.
Oh, really?
Well, they're gonna kill you.
But I've lost it.
an unacceptable answer!
But it's the truth.
Oh, jeez.
Hey. Hey.
Ooncentrate here, OK?
I need you to concentrate.
Just look at me, Danny,
look at me.
I'm a wreck. I'm a parody.
Julian, you gotta go up there
and finish this job.
No, no, just leave me alone.
Please, just forget everything.
I can't believe I'm in a stairwell
trying to convince you
to assassinate somebody!
Just go. Just go, Danny.
Just go. Go.
No.
No, we're gonna do this.
Julian, you have to.
Hey, you have to, OK?
If you don't, they're gonna kill you.
You understand?
Yeah.
You understand?
And I won't let that happen.
Huh? I refuse to let that happen.
How about that?
We're gonna go up there together,
I'm gonna talk you through it.
OK? I'm gonna
talk you through it.
And you are gonna do the job
that you came to do. OK?
OK? All right?
Yeah.
All right, up. Up, up, up, up.
There you go.
You're gonna stay there with me?
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
You're gonna talk me through it?
That's right.
Thank you.
All right, let's go kill
this motherfucker already
and get the hell
out of here.
Thank you.
No, really, I mean it.
I was a mess back there.
You helped me.
You helped me a lot.
I think I can handle
the deviant Julian.
I can handle the lying Julian.
I can even handle
the killing Julian.
I just don't know if I can
handle the humble pie Julian.
Well, enjoy it.
It won't last.
That's a given.
Really, it's...
...no problem.
You said it yourself.
I owed you.
Do you think if you hadn't opened
the door that night in Mexico Oity
the two of us would be
sitting on this plane now?
Probably not.
I want to say I'm sorry.
I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up.
But I'm sorry.
Oan't you see how guilty I feel?
Hold on, Julian.
I'm coming.
I don't know what I'll do
if I don't get this job.
And you're sure if I kill off this
Oardenas guy you'll get the contract?
He's our only competition.
And you can live with that?
Yeah.
You can live with
that blood on your hands, hm?
Isn't that what people do?
Don't people...
...successful people...
...always live with
blood on their hands?
that night, Julian.
You became my lifelong friend.
I'm not gonna do it for you.
You're making a late night...
...exhausted, desperate decision,
you would regret it instantly
and feel nothing
but guilt and shame
for the rest of your life,
believe me.
I'm so scared, Julian.
Guys like you...
...you think you have no luck.
But you have
all the luck in the world.
You just need to see it.
She's at home waiting for you.
If I did thatjob for you,
your luck would run bad
for the rest of your days.
You don't want me to do it, anyway.
I know you don't.
You're not that type of person.
That's why I like you.
You're the exact opposite of me.
I surprised myself.
Well...
...I guess your boss
must be satisfied, right?
You completed the assignment,
no longer on the hit list.
Well, I'm no longer
on the hit list,
but I didn't do any assignment.
I don't understand.
I thought your boss
wanted you to do this job.
My boss...
...Mr. Stick...
...he was the job.
You mean we just killed...
We killed the man
who wanted to kill me.
Problem solved.
You...
You son of a bitch.
Among many other things.
Don't ever hit me again.
Sorry.
nowhere else to run
for one more son?
the back of my broken hand
to perfection
Oh no. Don't make Lisa mad.
She might crush us all
with her giant butt.
Shut up, you. Stop teasing
the big-bottomed lass.
She's just as God made her...
Plump as a Christmas goose.
Dad... the kids at school
That's ridiculous, honey.
You're the cutest
little girl I know.
You just have
what is known as...
The Simpson butt.
Permit me to elaborate.
Every Simpson
starts with a circle.
Daddy has one
big circle here...
...then a smaller one up here...
two big, sexy circles for eyes...
one macho muzzle...
then a snappy new outfit.
Ooh, I'm looking good.
Ooh, cuffs. Yeah.
And for some reason, my hair
and ear form an "M" and a "G.
Party! Party!
Party! Party!
You want to know
a little trick?
To downsize my derriere,
I just tie a sweater around it.
See?
Oh, Homer, you're wasting
away to nothing.
You simply must eat something.
Well, you're the boss.
Oh, I love to see my man eat.
Check it out, Homes.
You said if I ever got
a hundred on a test,
You'd throw me a party.
There's my hundred...
where's my party?
Nice try, loser.
I bet you made up a fake test.
Nope, it's real...
Check out the watermark.
All right.
Here's a mistake.
It says the capital
of Kentucky... is Frankfort.
Dream on, pal.
Homer, the capital of
Kentucky is Frankfort.
Really?
Frankfurter...
Yes, it's something, dear.
See, it's all legit.
Now make with the party.
All right, boy, which con
did you work here?
Copy off another kid?
Pay attention and take notes?
Well, take note of this.
Bart really did
get a hundred.
I gave a test on state capitals,
but I forgot to roll up the map.
Everyone got a hundred.
I win. P-A-R-T.
Par-tee.
People, please.
It's a school night.
I thought
you two broke up.
This means nothing.
Yes, yes, you've
made that quite clear.
Maybe a different outfit would
make me look thinner.
This store makes me feel
even worse about myself.
I heard she's back
to her birth weight.
Must be nice.
No, no, the body on this
mannequin is all wrong.
I know. It's such an unrealistic
standard for young...
Planing down the thighs,
I make four bucks an hour
planing down the thighs.
I don't look so bad.
Don't worry, Lisa. You can still
find someone to love you.
Now you've got no choice.
Non !
Oh boy,
Barty's gonna party.
He sure is...
if he can keep up with
these party animals.
Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma,
Grandma Bouvier and...
Grampa.
Plus  your school-yard chums:
Martin and Ralph.
Bart's my bestest
boyfriend.
Oh Mom, this
guest list sucks.
It's the best I could do
on such short notice.
Where's Milhouse?
He's got the measles.
But we've got him on
speakerphone.
Rock on.
You know, the first time I met
Bart was at recess in first grade...
Oh, I told him
to use a land line.
Okay, gang, let's get
this party started.
or should I say Barted?
For our first game,
I need everyone to draw a
picture of President Eisenhower.
I drew him with Canadian Prime
Minister Louis St. Laurent.
Their relationship was
frosty at best.
Say "goose," you stupid freak.
Oh, Mom, this was
the worst party ever.
Gee, I did
the best I could...
Here's Lisa.
She'll save the party.
Honey, sit down.
Have a big slice of cake.
What? I'm not
fat enough already?
How could you say that to me?
Lisa,  wait...
Hello? Hello?
I had to leave 'cause my
French bread pizza dinged.
Hello?
What's the big deal...
Bart didn't like his presents.
So what? It's not like he
gives us such great gifts.
Remember that maple leaf ironed
between the sheets of wax paper?
What was that?
That was crap.
Oh, it's not just the presents.
The kids don't appreciate me anymore.
They'd rather hang out with
their friends than with their mom.
So they're growing up.
Soon they'll be leaving the nest,
and you'll have time for yourself.
hundreds of thousands of hours,
And then, the peace of the grave.
No!
No, I've got a lot more
mothering left in me.
I'll be right here at
3:00 to pick you up.
Then I'll take
you to the zoo.
We can eat fries
out of a safari hat!
No, thanks. I'm going to stay in
the library and do a little reading.
Well, I guess it's
just you and me, Bart!
Mom, after that
lame party you threw,
I'd rather hang out
with thunder-thighs here.
They grow up so fast.
They're just asserting
their independence.
If a child doesn't do it now,
it may never happen.
Seymour! Do you want your
vitamin in applesauce?
Or are you gonna take it
like a big boy?
Applesauce.
Oh, sure, you love
me now,
but you'll turn.
Stop struggling  and
get in my mouth, jerks!
Aren't you the boy
who beats up my son?
Prob'ly.
What's your name?
Simpson.
Oh, yeah. Bart Simpson.
Spiky hair, soft kidneys,
always hitting himself?
Those tadpoles
are your lunch?
Technically, brunch.
Well, here, take this.
My daughter didn't want
the lunch I made.
This sandwich rocks.
My tadpoles seem crude
by comparison.
You're nocturnal.
You don't have to impress me
by making fun of others.
I already like you.
I'm starting to let
down my guard.
Thanks, Mrs. S.
Today didn't
totally suck nard.
It's nice to be
appreciated.
Whatever.
Take it sleazy.
Mom?!
Nelson? I thought you were
sleeping in the park tonight.
Oh, that's okay, the kid
don't bother me none.
Hey, Nelson, say hello to Moe.
He said he'd take
you camping sometime.
Hey, kids,
I just heard they canceled league
night down at the bowling alley.
You know what that means?
Open lanes!
It'll be BLAM!
Bart, Lisa and...
Mom.
Mom, when I want lame
and needy, I'll call Milhouse.
No offense.
Fine!
I'll take my mothering elsewhere.
Ooh, great roll, Nelson.
Here, I cut up your
hot dog for you.
Wow, hot dogs are awesome!
You've never had one before?
No, but I saw some
in a catalog once.
People in sweaters were
eating them at a picnic.
So, my mom works at Hooters,
but  her dream is to go to Vegas
and work in a real strip club.
And, uh, where's
your dad in all this?
He  went out for a pack of
cigarettes and never came back.
He said "smell ya later,"
but he never smelled me again.
Nelson, how'd you like to earn some
extra money around our house?
I have some odd jobs
my kids won't do.
Yeah.
I get the feeling Bart isn't everything
he could be in the son department.
Sometimes I think he's more interested in
his "Itchy and Mitchy" cartoons than me.
I'm sure it's just a phase,
like when I used to stand on the overpass
and drop computers on the freeway.
That's how we get our Kaypro.
Hey, Lisa.
Are you counting how many days
it takes to wash your big butt?
I  can't hear you.
That's because your butt blocks your ears.
That doesn't make any sense.
Neither does your butt.
I know this obsession
with thinness is unhealthy..
and anti-feminist...
but that's what a
fat girl would say.
Lis, look!
Now, I know there's a handsome
young man behind all that hair and dirt.
Maybe not,
but you did a great
job on the lawn.
I mean, ma'am.
My mother...
my bully...
my God!
Lisa, just take a bite.
One bite...
That's all I ask!
Now, I can't have
toothpaste tonight.
Here's the money
you gave my son.
We don't want
your charity.
I didn't give
your son charity.
I gave him self-respect.
Self-respect, huh?
No wonder he came home with
his vest all buttoned...
like he was somebody.
Go home to your son,
Mrs. Muntz,
and try not to have
intercourse on the way!
Nelson, what are you
doing out this late?
My mom ditched me!
She went to Hollywood
to be an actress,
but her range is limited!
She's still your mother.
Come inside.
Can I get you
a glass of milk?
Cow milk?!
What are you doing
in my jammies?
I'm your new roommate.
I call top bunk.
it's a single bed.
I said top bunk!
Mom,
the reason God
invented dead bolts...
is to keep people like
Nelson out of your house.
Bart, have you ever eaten
a Tootsie Pop?
You know, there's
a tough, crunchy shell,
but if you lick it, there's
a delicious sweetness inside.
Be nice to Nelson, and I'll
give you a Tootsie Pop.
Morning, losers.
Mrs. Simpson.
Pancakes,
my favorite!
Bart, eat up or you'll
be late for school.
I'm not hungry.
You heard the lady,
clean your plate!
Savor it.
Let the flavors dance
on your palate.
Next on ABC,
Who's dropping by
to see George Lopez ?
We pray it's you!
Open.
Nelson, doesn't that
hurt your teeth?
My teeth hurt all the time.
I just try to think
about motorcycles.
I don't like
the sound of that.
Tomorrow I'm taking you
to Dr. Shapiro.
A doctor for your teeth?
What's next, a lawyer
for your hair?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me
in the night?
Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me
not be frightened?
Looking at the skies
I seem to see a million eyes...
Which ones are yours?
I gotta do something
about him.
This is the perfect test.
If I can have one dab
of frosting and then stop,
I'll know I've conquered
food at last.
That was too easy.
If I stop here,
I still have some dignity.
Well, at least she's
not singing Streisand.
Hey Lis, still insecure
about your body?
Yeah, a little.
Those mean girls
just get to me.
I understand.
I have a sister...
I think she's dead now
who had the same problem.
And I know just the solution.
Sherri. Terri.
The only thing sweeter
than you two...
are these stolen cookies.
Enjoy.
Thank you, Nelson.
Sherri smells,
Terri smells
Stinky all the way
One-horse open sleigh
Thank you, Nelson.
He who haw haws last,
haw haws best.
I really appreciate  you teaching
those mean girls a lesson.
Tomorrow I can bleach a
swear word into their hair.
I'd like that.
Nelson?
You came back!
I never meant
to leave you, Nelson.
But something awful happened
when I went to the store.
Well, that explains a lot.
Who's hungry?
No. I want to hear what
happened at the store.
Well, I went in
to buy cigarettes...
Could you gift-wrap them, please?
They're for my son.
I also bought myself
a candy bar,
which, uh, unfortunately  was filled
with peanuts,  to which I am allergic.
I ran outside  just as the
circus was  rolling into town.
And that's where I found him.
I brought him back here
so he could take Nelson away,
and my bruises would heal.
I want to give you
a home again, son.
And so do I.
Mom!
I got an acting job.
From the third director
I slept with.
I play Lady MacBeth.
I don't have
to take my top off,
but I do anyway.
Well, I'm glad everything
worked out so well.
The Muntzes are back
in business.
Yep, the Four Muntzes.
Thanks for finding
my Dad, Bart.
And thanks, lady, for making
me feel good about myself.
So, now that you're happy again,
I guess you won't beat me up
at school anymore.
I wish it were that simple.
I really do.
They're a family again.
And so are we.
What happened?
Sometimes you have to
adopt your son's bully
in order to bring your own
family temporarily closer.
And Lisa, what
have you learned?
Nothing.
Like many women, I still have an
unhealthy obsession with my weight.
But talking about the problem is the
first step towards the solution, right?
I guess.
But there's
a long way to go.
Come on, say
something conclusive.
I'm afraid this is a very
open-ended problem.
Oh, open-ended?!
Oh, come on, Lisa.
Say everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
That was you.



He went on like we were buddies.
It drove me nuts!
Then it clicked.
This wasn't my dad, here.
He'd become like a kid
that I was responsible for.
Like I was the dad, see?
See what happens?
You wake up one morning
and things have switched places.
Gimme a light.
The bitch of it is, you're helpless.
You can scream and kick
the walls, it's no goddamn use.
Time's moved on,
your dad's an old man,
you're not immortal anymore.
Do you believe in God?
Times like that
make you start to believe.
Finally, you learn to put up with it.
Then my dad fell sick and I...
I nursed him like a baby.
Wiped his ass, fed him,
cleaned his mouth...
The worst thing was,
I didn't want it to stop.
The year after that,
I had my first kid.
I don't see why.
I really don't see why.
I told you about a house
on Rue Carrel.
On the east side.
You didn't mention the west side.
Whichever side,
you knew it was my patch!
Why not the whole region?
You pulled a fast one on me,
Can't you kill the sound
and your cigar?
How much d'you want?
Dunno.
Don't know?
50-50? I set up the deal
and you take half for nothing?
Hot stuff!
Hang on!
I can bring know-how and cash.
Sure! Take a lot of know-how
to make me swallow that.
What's your offer?
Nothing. Nada!
You're the one sweating it.
I don't need you.
That's a new one!
Hear that, Sami?
I don't give a shit.
Do your business.
Do your deal
and stop crapping about it.
I'll give you 'I don't need you.'
In the last six months...
Who found the warehouses?
Without me, you'd still be
haggling with that old bag.
And the tennis courts...
Tennis courts?
The acre along the highway.
If you don't remember that,
what you need is a doctor!
So what's your offer?
I told you, 50-50.
OK, plus half of the Belgrand deal.
Like fuck!
Belgrand's worth four times Massy!
Don't give me that!
If Massy's worth shit,
why make such a big deal of it?
On the left.
Cut it out!
You go that way.
Two floors up.
I can't see!
Gimme a flashlight. You have a spare.
What's going on up there?
Search me. A rat must've bit him.
The asshole scared me!
It ran up my leg and bit me!
Where? Let me see.
Fuckin' bit me all over!
I can't see.
What do you want?
My smokes.
OK, fuck you.
Fuck you!
I've thought it over. It's a deal.
What's a deal?
What we said.
Massy and the Belgrand place, 50-50.
When's the due date?
How much under the table?
250,000 each. OK with you?
One thing I don't get about Beefy.
If he hates rats,
why does he plant them?
Why not plant something else?
What, snakes?
Or his mother?
Feeling better?
And you?
Go away!
When will you be done?
This part tonight.
The rest in two days, minimum.
Thursday?
I'm signing the deal at 11 AM.
Get me the plans by 8.
Course you can!
What's the rush?
We can beat him down.
He owes Martens 60,000.
I'll tell Martens to collect.
Why would he?
I know him. He owes me one.
If he finds out,
we'll find ourselves buying from him.
Don't be paranoid. He won't know.
You handle Martens,
I'll fix the lawyer and City Hall.
You can't go in there!
You're trespassing!
They broke the lock!
You're trespassing on private property!
Where are you going? Get out!
What's your problem?
I own this place!
Clear out.
You're crazy!
No, I'm the owner.
No entry!
I live here.
No! No, you don't.
Where were you?
Stuck in traffic. I came quick...
Can't you ever do what you say?
I was stuck in traffic!
Bullshit! The watchman says
you never came here once.
And now look!
Get this zoo out of here!
Who are you?
Leave them alone.
Who are you?
Housing Rights group.
You the owners?
Guess!
This is illegal.
The law's on our side.
They've been here 48 hours.
There's water, power.
It's their home now.
You want your building back,
find a place to rehouse them.
We can get the cops.
The cops are right there. Go get them!
They're not squatters, they're families.
That's the point.
They've only occupied the street side,
not the back yet.
Get Lesrec and his guys here quick
or we're stuck for six months.
How many apartments are there?
Won't be so easy now!
Halfass!
Did you order?
I was waiting for you.
Boy, that looks... What is it?
Electro.
Try it?
You dig this for real?
Seriously?
I listen to it!
What's this shit called again?
Why are you jumpy? Balls itch?
You wanted to talk.
What if I got married again?
Do I know her?
Not yet. I asked her
to come meet you.
Wait till you see her.
A beaut!
She's got tits...
legs up to her chin...
That should do.
Am I making you awkward?
Do you have to marry her?
Have to?
No, why?
She's not pregnant.
That's not what I meant.
Tell me straight.
You say no, I won't.
Do it, Dad.
If that's what you want.
If it makes you happy, do it.
Sure! Do it.
One other thing.
There's a couscous joint
owes me six months' rent.
Every time I ask for it, he whines,
'My wife's pregnant,
my daughter's getting married,' etc.
Guess what? The rat's buying
tax-deductible real estate!
He's fleecing me
and lining his nest with it!
Can you fix him?
It won't take you a minute.
I wrote it all down here.
Here comes Gorgeous!
My son Thomas, Chris.
I have a call to make.
Sit there, I won't be long.
Want a drink?
A kir.
You?
I'm fine.
So you're Robert's son?
What do you do?
I model, for catalogs.
And commercials, if I can.
I auditioned for one this morning.
Competition must be stiff.
All those East European girls.
Why East European?
It's just the way I heard it.
You're in real estate, like Robert?
How's business?
So what's Chris short for?
Yvonne?
No, Christine.
Are you getting at me?
Did I offend you?
Why are you getting at me?
Are you serious about Robert?
I think so.
We haven't known each other long.
We go out and have fun.
He makes me laugh.
Introduces me to people.
I love my dad.
I don't want him taken for a ride
and have to pick up the pieces.
Did you order?
Order, I'll be back.
Why are you leaving?
I forgot an appointment.
How do you like her?
You're the one marrying her.
I know, but what do you think?
Nothing.
What's that mean?
She's a whore, Dad.
Why? Because she
models and stuff?
Because she's a whore!
You asked me, I answered.
Hey, forget it.
Forget it. Sorry I spoke.
Mr. Fox!
Could you ask that gentleman...
Don't you recognize me?
Thomas Seyr.
Sonia's son?
Tom, right?
How old are you now?
You're here for the concert?
Did you hear him play at Pleyel?
I missed it.
You'll see he's very good.
I'm his manager.
Have you kept it up?
Do you still play the piano?
Yes... and no.
It got complicated after Mom died.
That's a shame.
You had talent.
I remember you
played something for me.
A Haydn sonata, number 32.
It's starting.
I'll be off.
Here's my card.
Come play piano for me.
Come for an audition.
Call my assistant and set a date.
Don't let me down.
I can't focus.
Try again?
I'm too...
My heart's beating too hard.
No good!
I'm too nervous. I can't do it.
It's not perfect.
Very close.
Close but not quite!
It looks easy but...
It's very clean.
But the emotion is not very generous.
Can I help you?
You last played when?
About ten years ago.
Ten years without practice?
I practice.
I never gave up completely.
I play for myself,
when I'm in the mood, or for friends.
And now you're auditioning?
That's right.
You're too old for the conservatory.
For a competition?
For an agent. A manager.
Manager?
So he'll take me on.
I'm confused.
You're not a professional pianist?
So why a manager?
He offered to audition me.
My mother was a concert pianist...
He managed her concerts.
I grew up with music.
There was always a piano at home...
I know about it.
If I'm good,
I think he'll take me on.
As what? A pianist?
A concert pianist?
May I ask what you do?
I work.
In what field?
I work in real estate.
I'm a broker, see?
I plant rats in buildings,
cut off the water and power.
Sometimes me and my pals
go in with baseball bats
and force people out of their homes.
What exactly do you want?
Play me something, go on.
What are you doing?
Fuck you, prick!
What's the big idea?
It's an agency downtown.
Call Madame Bouffera.
I spoke with her.
I told you about it. I'm not wacko.
Tell her I sent you and call me back.
What do you want?
I heard you talking to our teacher.
You want piano lessons?
Just someone to judge my playing.
I have a friend, a pianist.
Her name is Miao Lin.
She just arrived in Paris.
She studied at the Beijing Conservatory
and won a two-year scholarship.
She has given lessons and concerts.
Are you interested?
Depends.
If so, call this number
and ask for Jean-Pierre.
Who's Jean-Pierre?
Me.
What's this rathole?
I've got business nearby.
How's it going?
A strange thing happened.
Remember Mr. Fox?
He managed Mom's concerts.
Tall, faggoty jerk?
I ran into him, we talked.
Guess what?
He asked me for an audition.
Audition? You?
Why not me?
Think I'm not up to it?
Audition for what?
I don't know yet. Depends.
Depends on what?
Look how your mom ended up.
Don't talk about her that way.
What way do you want?
Your Fox is a pimp.
He didn't deal
with her fits like I did.
At the end, you didn't even see her.
It was me she talked to.
Don't give me that shit.
What's it to be?
Same as him.
Remember that favor I asked you?
What favor?
The couscous jerk
who owes me six months rent.
Sorry, no time.
No time?
Time to see that fag
and get psyched up about pianos,
but not 20 minutes for me.
Don't get anal about it. I forgot.
I'll see him, end of story.
That's handy. He's across the street.
I don't believe it!
How can you pull this on me?
You said you'd do it, do it.
Is this payback time or what?
Will you do it or not?
No way! Not like this.
Fix your own shit.
Asshole.
Beat it!
Mounir! The kitchen's on fire!
Quick! There's a fire!
Freeze!
My dad's money!
Touch my dad again, I'll kill you.
Here.
Not so hard, was it?
Do me a favor.
Forget me for a while.
Is that how you want it?
How else do you want it?
My friend, Miao Lin.
What is your name?
What do you need exactly?
For an audition,
to know where I stand.
Hold it. Doesn't
she speak French?
She only just got here.
Only Chinese?
Chinese, Viet, and a little English.
Does it matter, no French?
No smoking, no talking?
Pain in the...
We will work it out, don't worry.
She can coach you real well.
She has coached musicians
for competitions.
She is very good.
Do you need some tea?
What about timing and money?
Mornings she has classes,
otherwise she's free.
Every day at 2 PM, OK?
That one looks good.
It's pushing it, sizewise.
Over 350 square meters,
City Hall may poke its nose in.
You're trading business
premises for housing...
Can you show me
Montmorency Villas again?
Same problem.
I have an architect friend...
I'm Thomas Seyr.
Mr. Fox asked me to call.
He told you?
An audition, yes.
Date?
I don't know.
What's available?
I'll hold.
We've made a shortlist.
I forgot something.
Seyr again. We got cut off.
Go on, I'm listening.
The 23rd? 11 o'clock?
Suits me fine.
Where? What's the address?
Are you busy tonight?
I told Aline we're having dinner.
She'll believe it if she sees you.
Pick me up from home.
I cross town so you get laid?
Attaboy!
Who is she?
Who cares?
Tell me or I won't come.
The realty chick from uptown.
Same as before?
The other one.
I won't do it.
Asshole!
You've come for him?
We're running late.
Dinner with a client?
How've you been?
Will you be out late?
Not very.
Does he know I'm here?
He's on the phone.
Fabrice! Tom's here.
Coming!
Night, honey.
I won't be late.
Bye.
She suspects something.
She doesn't suspect, in fact...
she's happy I'm with you.
Next time, know what?
We change tactics. You drive me home.
To save me from driving home drunk.
Is that all?
You smug, skirt-chasing smartass!
Don't you have any class?
Don't forget the bank tomorrow.
The loan for the Massy place.
You want half, do half the work.
What time?
Horowitz was the magician
who revealed all the piano's magic...
and especially its sparkle.
He had the most
marvelous pianist's hands...
like a delicately muscled racehorse.
I can't do it.
Having somebody
behind me puts me off.
I can't take it. It won't work.
I'm not used to it.
Come over here. Stand here.
Look that way.
Two Jacks on the rocks.
Guess what? Verodin told me
he wants to build on the east side.
He's tight with the Illouz
brothers, so I kept quiet.
But he came on strong,
I want to work with you guys.
I told him about
the Bussy flour mills.
Guess what? He said he's through
with the Illouz brothers.
He's sick of getting shafted.
That's Number 172,
with the vacant lot.
The homeowner's getting divorced.
He'll need dough.
Stick our card in his mailbox,
he'll call us next week.
That's not my car.
It's mine.
If you puke, you go in the trunk.
Is that you?
Who else?
Everything OK?
I put him there.
You want him in the bedroom?
That's fine.
Well, I'll...
Wait a sec.
Fabrice said he may sell this place.
Is it true?
He didn't tell me.
Is business bad?
Not good.
Another drink?
Yeah, OK.
One more and I'll go.
Like this?
Yeah, I know.
Like this?
Excuse me.
I need to talk to my partner.
There's a room next door.
Are you trying to screw me?
It's not what we said.
It's not the same price.
What's my call to Martens worth?
Name a price.
You're a rat!
Stop right there!
Rats are lazy slobs
who live off other people's work!
You want to redraft the contract
and meet with your lawyer?
It's me.
Hi there!
Been out on the town?
I went to a movie.
Which one?
Hungry? They're closing.
Have a seat.
You've been eating?
What's the matter?
That's odd.
Isn't Fabrice with you?
No, why?
We're eating later but I got hungry.
I skipped lunch.
We're meeting with a client uptown...
How will you warn him?
Call him on your cell phone
from the john?
'She's here, help!
What do I do? '
How long have you been fooling me?
Fooling you? How?
How long's it been going on?
I dunno.
How can you not know?
Since day one, I guess.
Whenever he says he's going out
with you, he's getting laid?
Listen...
One girl or several?
Gimme a break! I don't fuckin' know.
You never see them?
No, and I don't care!
Don't care?
I don't give a shit.
Why do you do it?
Why I do it?
You wouldn't understand.
Listen...
Aline, wait!
Stay away from me!
Fuck off!
Why do I cover for him?
Because I love you.
Get lost.
Did you hear me? I love you!
That's how it is. I want you.
Did you never feel it?
Something between us.
So it's all in my mind?
Yes.
It can't be!
Whenever we meet, we're tongue-tied
and shy, like two little kids.
Is that normal?
Honestly, am I?
Idiot.
You know I'm not making it up.
So, what now?
I don't know.
I have to go. He'll be home soon.
What do you care? Stay.
I'm leaving. Let's call each other.
That's good.
God, you're making my day.
If you're so damn good, show me.
I play like that?
No, come off it.
I get it!
Of course!
Move over.
Faucet.
Glass.
Wrong. Cup.
Matches.
Saucepan.
If you couldn't make the meeting,
why didn't you call me?
Did you make it to the bank?
You got the files, didn't you?
For fuck's sake...
His secretary's gonna try and catch him.
Anything else you maybe forgot?
All right already.
What's all right?
I messed up. Nobody died.
If we lose the permit, we're fucked.
I realize that.
So what do we do?
You got his secretary. What can I do?
Nothing. It's the best thing.
I'm sick of this. Later.
So what's going on? Because...
Nothing.
Nothing?
You don't want to tell me?
Tell you what?
Playing piano is making you flip?
Stop it. Now!
Nothing's making me flip.
I'm not flipping.
I'm having a ball. I feel fantastic!
Don't you see?
It's important. I'm serious about it.
It's wicked.
You gonna make dough from pianos?
Not pianos. The piano!
It's not about making money.
It's about art.
What's in it for us?
You coming to meetings all mellow?
Hi guys, I've been playing piano.
Shit, I'll take up the banjo.
It's over your head.
It isn't at all.
Do what you like to relax after hours.
I make balsa models with my kids
and I still keep my appointments.
But it's not about appointments.
You don't seem on the ball.
Get on the ball, then do what you want.
Collect Panini figures, baseball cards,
do your piano, nobody cares.
Did you tell your dad?
Yeah.
What did he say?
It grabs him.
Grabs him?
It's me.
How's it going?
What are you doing now?
Thinking of me?
All the time?
Think of me all the time.
I think of you.
I need to see you.
Please!
I've had a shitty day.
Don't you start.
What are you wearing?
It matters. Pants? A dress?
God, I knew it!
What underneath?
Stockings? Panties?
You don't have to shout. Whisper.
Pantyhose? Any panties?
Do you love me or not?
You love me!
Do you still fuck him?
Do you still fuck Fabrice?
What's wrong with you?
I'm only asking if you fuck.
Yes or no?
You have no right to ask me that.
So that's it!
When you leave me, you fuck him.
He's my husband!
I know. And what am I?
Why not ask me
if I fuck someone else?
It's none of my business.
Of course it is, if you love me.
Do you fuck someone else?
Yeah.
You fuck someone else?
Careful!
Get off my ass!
I don't understand you!
This is all useless!
I'm sick of it!
Where? I can't see you.
What bus shelter?
I'm there.
I see you. I'm coming.
Need a hospital?
Take me home.
Get a move on!
Lean forward.
Breathe deep.
What do you care
what happened to me?
We're done talking, right?
You gonna sit there all day
staring at me like a mutt?
Suit yourself.
See if I care.
What's the matter with you?
Stop it!
OK, now.
I was set to get half the site
just by putting up the cash deposit.
The site was valued at two million
but easily worth double.
Gently!
That hurt?
Want another pill?
I figured a profit of 2.5 million
on 300,000...
wasn't bad.
So I put up the cash and we signed.
A month later, I heard
the city had blocked the sale
so I asked him to pay back my cash.
He said sure, Monday, no problem.
Come Monday, zilch.
How long ago was it?
About... three months.
I kept at him
but he stopped taking my calls.
Socks?
Leave them on.
When I heard he was in town,
I went there.
Who is he?
His name is...
Minskov.
You don't know him.
He's a Russian.
Where did you find him?
The Riviera, where else?
You don't say.
Can you handle it?
No answer?
What do you expect me to say?
How's your fiancée?
It's over.
Call me!
What happened with my dad?
That's why you wanted to see me?
Not specially.
But I need to know what happened.
Shouldn't I care about him?
No. He's the father, not you.
I'm not sure anymore.
Did you walk out?
He dumped me.
Beat me to it by an inch.
He'd become a total pain.
Always griping and yelling at me.
You said you had fun.
At first. It wore off.
I'm going to ask you something.
Go back to him.
Are you crazy?
Wait, I know what you'll say.
I say no.
Think of it as a contract,
like a role in a film.
You act.
I'm the producer, I cough up.
How much do you get as a model?
I'll pay you the same.
No, double! It's worth it.
Just stick with him,
watch what he gets up to.
I'll call you twice a day
and you'll tell me if he's doing OK.
That's all.
If something goes wrong
or he starts acting weird
or you lose him,
give me a call.
See? Nothing to it, right?
I'm not a whore, you know.
What do you mean?
Who says you're a whore?
You.
You did. Robert told me.
I'm his son, right?
Can't expect miracles!
I know.
Mr. Minskov, please.
Did Mr. Minskov go out?
He's in the pool.
Should I call him?
Don't bother him.
St. James Albany Hotel?
Mr. Minskov, please.
It's personal.
Mr. Minskov?
I'm Mr. Seyr's son.
You don't know me...
Don't you speak French?
Don't speak French, asshole?
What an asshole!
You understand scumbag,
motherfucker?
I'll ram French up your ass!
Understand that?
Gloogloo?
You look pretty glooey!
Listen! Money.
You understand that?
Remember Robert Seyr, fuckwit?
Listen, Gloogloo...
Can I talk to you, Miss?
Hang on, there's a guy...
I need to talk.
Lotsa love. See you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.
Minskov owes me money.
What do I care?
Are those two apes always with him?
I'm not talking to you.
You could answer my question!
Hands off!
I just want to meet Minskov.
You're getting boring.
Minskov can drop dead.
Matter of fact,
I just need to call him and you're dead.
I get it.
That's why you stay with him.
So you can say shit like
'I call him, you're dead.' What a buzz!
I get it.
But it's the opposite, right?
You're scared shitless.
You're shaking.
You have goosebumps.
Wild, right?
You need his permission to breathe.
Are you done?
Fuck off.
It's me.
Again? Go away or I'll scream.
No need to scream.
You're a pain!
Tell me one thing.
I don't understand.
How old are you?
You're young, not dumb.
Why stick with him?
You don't even speak Russian.
You don't need to.
He just fucks you and slaps you around.
Forget it.
Speak up. I can't hear you.
We're all alone.
We can't see each other.
Whatever. I'm interested.
What did you do before?
I didn't hear. Say it again.
I said I should stop...
What are you doing?
Where are you?
You've moved!
What on earth...
Make room for me.
Move over!
Here I come!
What do you mean,
you only had him on the phone?
What did the bastard come up with?
Dad, you're gonna have
to forget your money.
Forget it.
Stop thinking about it,
stop counting it at night.
Write it off and move on.
The guy's dangerous.
He's a thug, a killer.
He's not the Illouz brothers.
He's not one of us.
You crossed his path.
It was a mistake.
Forget it.
Hold on.
What did you talk about on the phone?
Just bullshit.
Didn't you try anything?
I told you, there's no way.
I fucked his girlfriend.
You fucked his girlfriend?
I just told you.
I ask you to get my money back
and all you do is fuck his chick?
I don't believe it.
You're turning dumb.
You're turning very dumb.
You there, Dad?
She said she'd gone off sex
since they split up.
I thought, no chance.
We snort a line in the john.
Like hitting a magic button. Pow!
She goes sex-crazy.
Grabs my dick and sucks it.
Can't you say excuse me?
Sorry.
A real friend!
We went on to her girlfriend's place.
Her girlfriend, man!
We're at it till 5 AM.
I'm seeing her tonight.
I told Aline I'm eating with you.
OK, right.
Don't move.
Stay like that.
What's the matter?
Wait, please.
I'm cold.
Wait a second.
Really?
I'm off.
You think this'll help?
I heard you.
I know you're in there!
Open up!
I've been ringing for hours!
I was asleep.
Get dressed and come.
Verodin's buying the whole site!
So?
He's ready to sign tonight. Come on!
I'm not going out.
Let's discuss it tomorrow.
You heard me? Verodin's buying!
He's leaving tomorrow for two weeks.
It can wait two weeks.
It can't. He's waiting to sign now.
Move your foot please.
Come off it!
You know what Verodin's worth?
I need sleep. Move your foot.
Is this your piano crap?
What's keeping you?
He won't come, God knows why.
Are you in there?
I'm not going out.
Mind explaining?
I don't want to.
I have a big day tomorrow.
What's big about tomorrow?
Does it concern Sami and me?
Go to hell.
What's he up to?
Where are you?
Cut the crap. Open up!
It's not only your money, it's ours too.
You can't do this to us!
Open this fucking door.
I'll kick it in. And your head!
Stop it! They'll call the cops.
Which way?
Don't ask me!
OK, got it!
Wait! He wants to
see the place again.
He wants another look.
Now?
Now. Come on.
For Christ's sake!
Bring the keys.
For fuck's sake!
Gimme the keys.
Get a move on!
Some jerks moved in upstairs.
What are you going to do?
Guess.
Move it!
Rise and shine!
Snap, crackle, pop!
You got music? Cool!
Thomas Seyr?
You're next.
The Toccata in E minor, right?
You can sit there if you like.
Call me, we'll meet.
Don't let me down.
Thomas Seyr is here.
Come!
All set?
You're going to play
the Toccata in E Minor?
Mind starting with the fugue?
No, sure.
Want to start over?
I don't understand it.
I can play this piece.
By myself, I play it fine.
Don't worry.
Call me when you're ready.
I'm sorry.
Two years later
Hear me?
Yes, Mr. Seyr.
I'm done. Don't let
anybody on stage.
OK, Mr. Seyr.
Everything OK?
How did it go?
Did they take pictures?
Were they nice to you?
Want to sit in the back?
No, in front with you.
How do you feel?
I'm aching all over.
Are we late?
We're fine.
I changed the tour dates
for Lyon and Geneva.
Did I mention the dinner with EMI UK?
Eyvind Johnson's in Paris next week.
He wants to see you.
Which evening's best?
I don't know.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.
Is it still sore?
Let me.
Umbrella!
I'll park and come.
Yes, 2137
Mr. Lee, don't forget to call Crystal
Got it
Although the South East Asian Financial
crisis
seems to be extending
l don't think it will affect Hong Kong
l've tried to reach you for three days
the stock declined over 500 points
and you're here fiddling your shoes?
What can l do?
l believe that HK won't be affected
we have a foreign exchange reserve of
90 billion US dollars
we're world's number three
Of course you are going to be
the Asian Sores
Sores
Sores?
No thanks, l'll leave that for your dad
Me? l just want to hold his daughter
You're a Nobody and you want me to
marry you?
We are World's third in terms of
foreign exchange reserve
we have over 90 billion US dollars
we have a very healthy economic
structure
moreover, we have the full backup of
the China market.
l'm worried that the drop will affect our
investments in South East Asia
l understand, Mr. Albert,
but l can guarantee that everything will
be fine
Then l have to trust you, but if/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'
Excuse me, please hold on
The morning market will be closed
in 15 minutes
but it has declined 713 points already
and with the full backup from
the China market
Clear all of 3006
Because we have 90 billion US dollars
as foreign exchange reserve
The Government won't let the market fall
any further
Let's hold on for a while
we shall be able to sell once there's
a profit margin
Buy 3005 for all of my accounts
What are you thinking? Come on! Go!
The Commissioner of Finance once
mentioned that the crash would probably
be over around Christmas
By that time, l believe the Hang Seng
lndex will re-bounce to the level of
18,000 points
We lost fifty million dollars
There's nothing to live for/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'
l agree
l wish that someone rich will take care of
Your mom must be crazy
How would someone rich adopt you?
The baby!
l'm sorry
ls he all right?
Not very good
His body temperature and blood
pressure are very low
How can you be so careless?
Adopting a child?
So you've already cleared up the mess
in the company?
Just picked up a baby back and be his
adopted father?
Wanna check your blood pressure, Miss
lt's free
Next time then
Ming, You come to see me?
Ming, l'm going to treat you and Wing
with dessert tonight
You want to take advantage of him again
What advantage?
Wing said you always take advantage
of others
But l'm making your favorite green bean
dessert
Don't you like it?
l like
So you'll bring Wing with you tonight
for dessert, OK
See you then
Bye
Watch your steps
Lan, didn't l tell you not to set
your stall here?
They can charge you on blocking
the road
Sir Lung, You don't go and warn those
money-making stalls at the back
but to complain about me who is doing
free social services?
The Hawker's Control Team will take
care of them
but affecting road order is my
responsibility, don't you see?
Just in case some stupid guy drives a
vehicle down and hit you
l can't bear that responsibility if anything
happens to you
You spooky mouth! Who would want
you to be responsible?
l don't mean that, just move a hit
Ming, Come and touch my mahjong for
luck
Where's Wing?
He's not back yet, just wait for a while
Want a popsicle, Ming
No, Thank you
No, thank you
Put this back for me
Go and play
ls it really so difficult for a fresh grad to
get a job now?
lt's no good to have our neighbors
seeing you.
sitting here all day doing nothing
Get a job
lt's not that difficult to get a job, sister
but it's hard to find a job which you
really enjoy
don't you understand?
What do you like to do? l'll help you
Let's eat
You're not finishing this round?
Let me help you
How's your luck today?
lt's too late, my pockets are emptied
already
Take it easy, man
l'm leaving
Bye
Lan asked us to go over to have dessert
tonight
Really? She wants to take advantage
of me again?
This is what l told her too
Did you really say that?
Done
Wing, please fix those hanging hooks
in the kitchen too
Didn't you fix them yesterday?
You did! They're so useful
So l bought three more today, thanks
This one is for Chuen, go and get your
own in the kitchen
O.K. l'll help himself
Sir Lung?
l'm sorry
but your boxes outside blocked the fire
exit
l thought these are concerns of the
Fire Department
Well, in case of any accident, it will be
too late
When l'm out on the road, you said
l'm blocking the road
when l'm home, you said l'm blocking
the fire exit
Are you picking on me
lt's nothing like that
The new Fire Ordinance
it's illegal to block the fire exit
And besides, so many elderly living at
your place
if the Fire Department discovers this
they'll charge you on illegal running an
elderly home
l'll help you to bring them in
No thanks, l'll do it myself
Want some dessert?
lt's all finished, l didn't expect you
Next time then
Jogging?
Keeping fit
Next time then
l'm teaching you this today: No problem
No, problem, low/.,;'/.,;'/.,;' paul/.,;'/.,;'/.,;' pump
What is no problem?
l'll teach you another phrase: no good
Don't stay so close to the TV, it's bad
for your eyes
Come, let's sit here
Tell me what you are watching?
l hereby on behalf of the committee of
the Children's Hope Project
would like to thank the support of all
the kind donors
l'm now in Shanghai and cannot attend
this Charity show in Hong Kong
which reminds me that our organization
might have neglected a lot of friends
around us
l would like to take this opportunity
on behalf of my former husband's
organization
donate 100 million Hong Kong dollars
to help those in need in Hong Kong
We'll consider any kind of proposals
Thank you
Thank you Mrs. Leung
Dear Audience
if you do have a kind heart like
Mrs. Leung
think carefully how you would like to
help those children
Yes, and then send a proposal to us
Yes, thank you
Thank you Mrs. Leung
Thank you for joining us, good-bye
Thanks for the job well done
Thank you
Mrs. Leung, the orphanage which you
supported at Putin
will be celebrating their 2nd anniversary
next month
the children has rehearsed some
programs for you
they hope you can come and join them
Excuse me, Mrs. Lee
Mrs. Leung has a business trip to US
next month
We'll see, OK
No problem, of course work comes first
we can arrange in the future
l should leave you to rest now, good-bye
l'm sorry, bye
Welcome Mrs. Leung! Welcome
Don't
Please go out
Mrs. Leung is tired
Please go away
Please
Are you all right? Mrs. Leung?
Mrs. Leung, let's go out for dinner,
and relax/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'
l don't want to go anywhere
l just want to go back Hong Kong
tomorrow morning
You want to see Dr. Chung?
l'll arrange an appointment
Or, do you want to try other doctors?
l think l'll be scared of children for the
rest of my life
Whatever l do is useless
lt's very difficult for me to mix with kids
Don't feel so bad
Things may get better
Thank you
You go back and rest now, l'm fine
Don't stay up too late then
We can have a bigger sitting area here
if l knock down the room at the back
Knock down that room?
Wing, take this
Here?
Are you sure?
You said there's lot of stuff left from your
husband inside there
and you wanna knock the room down
if not, there won't be enough space for
the children's home
Ten and a half feet
Ten and a half times twelve feet should
be big enough
Think twice
No need
These two years, the elderly has gone
one by one
most of them have gone to 'the other side
of the world''
This neighborhood has a lot of children
wandering around
a children's home can take care of them
Over, Over! Ming forgets his clothes
Over, Over! Ming forgets his clothes
Are you there? Wing?
l don't know where your clothes are
go get yourself
Wing! He's still a baby, you asked him
to get it himself?
He's four and still a baby?
Then l'm thirty something baby
How can you ask me to do so much?
Wing! Come over! Wing
Now what?
Hold this for me, l want to measure this
area
5 feet
You're not wearing your slippers again
Your feet will looks like frog's feet when
you grow up
Wing! l want to build a wall downstairs
to separate the elderly and the children's
home
Good
And here, will be the children's bathroom
Here?!
l'll get it! l'll get it
You go then
Let's move on, Lan, what else?
You're still not wearing your slippers
l know, l know
So why don't you buy me more
Hello Wing? lt's Wah
l'm Ming
Anyway
tell Wing to go to Deep Water Bay
Dockyard to work this Saturday
Saturday
Don't forget
l won't
Bye
Wah asked you to go to work this Sat
at the Deep Water Bay Dockyard
OK, Mark my appointment for me
No problem, Lan l'll write the proposal
for you
Wing, if the plan succeeded
Ming can bath at my place
OK, Ok, l get it
You'd better rest now
Wing! You must make a good proposal
Ok, l will
Ming, go to be early after your bath, bye
Say good-bye
Good-bye
You're hurting him
l'm playing with him
You're only a four years old baby
and you're not ready for this
My usual treat! Please
Only Ming and do it
So comfy
Wing, l want to buy a popsicle
You're thirsty
Come back soon
Hey, You're looking for someone?
Are you that lady on TV?
You're in the wrong place, please go!
l don't have time to play with you,
please go back
Excuse me, did you see a kid around?
This tall?
No
Does it hurt?
No
What's your name?
Ming, four years old
You were with your mother?
l don't have a mother
Oh! l've got to go! Bye
Hey kid! Why are you here?
Mrs. Leung, are you Ok
How can they just have these kids
wandering around
You, did you make a mess at the boat?
No
l know you won't tell me
but if you'll do this again
You'll not only hurt your hand but your
foot as well
OK! Done
You took advantage of me again
The fish is mine
You're right! Just to remind you not to
trust people so easily
Have a bit more
You're full?
Full
Full! Ok, now wipe your mouth!
go to sleep
Go ahead, l'll still got work to do
OK, just two phrases
This one's better! This one
Thank you
Sir Lung
lt's raining like shit, come on over
This grumpy rain
You look busy today, running back and
forth
lf you sell umbrellas here, people will
complaint
You've been working with the Hawkers'
Control Team
l'm responsible for maintaining road
order
Just in case someone stupid drives
a vehicle down and hit you
l can't take the responsibility
l'm not asking you to leave, just be
careful
l will
Hey, Wing
Why aren't Lan measuring people's
blood pressure these few days?
She's sick! Why don't you go and
see her?
lt's not serious, is it?
Quite
lt's just that l didn't see her around
Got to go and work
Go and see her
Send my regards to Lan
All right!
Lan is ill, you go and see her
l know, Ming, good boy
Watch the umbrellas, let's have fun/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'
Let me do it
See
Umbrellas
l thought giving my child to someone rich
he'll be happier
and then l can start all over again
but finally understand that
losing someone close is even more
painful than being poor
l've tried very hard
and l still can't find my own child
and then l got this fear
l can't get close to kids
but, it's strange
l'm not afraid of Ming
l was a bit scare at the very beginning
but then afterwards, l'm fine
maybe it's because l was helping with
his wounds, distracted
l think it's a good start
you begin to open up yourself to others
not only children, but other people
as well
l believe this is the only way that
can heal your psychological fear
l've got something for you
New medication
No
l've brought this movie for you,
a children movie
you'll watch it before you go to sleep
tonight
and you'll let me know in the morning
Whether you can sleep or not, or
nightmare? OK
Thank you
l'm leaving now
l'll see you to the door
Thank you, Doctor Jones
Oh yes, you have been torturing yourself
for four years
Whatever you have done wrong in
the past, should more or less be justified
Take care, good-bye
Mrs. Leung, we've received eight
proposals today
This one is quite interesting, take a look
Changing a elderly home to children's
home?
Playing with fire is very dangerous
You may burn someone, yourself
or even a whole house if you're not
careful, you know that
There're many other fun things to play
with the fire
Give me the candle! Give it to me
And you, what's that in your pocket?
Cigarettes?
Give it to me
Why don't you play yo-yo when you
have one?
Give it to me
Did you steal this?
No
No
Let me teach you how to play this
Bring the dog out
Baby's cradle
Around the world
Here the top one, Extravaganza
Play yo-yo and not fire, OK
Go now, or l'll spat you
Watch the cars
l'm sorry, Miss,
did they hurt you?
l'm fine
May l ask you where is this Lan's
Elderly Home?
At the back, over there
Thank you!
Let me show you the way! lt's difficult
to find
Sorry about the trouble
You're from somewhere?
l came from Shanghai
You're very tall
Who are you looking for at the Lan's?
No, my uncle wants to find
an elderly home
l hope you don't mind me being nosy
the place actually can't be taken as an
elderly home, there's no facilities
Lan is a kind person
but now can she take care of so many
elderly on her own
Just taking care of their meals would
have killed her
Your uncle should go somewhere else
Excuse me, who is Lan?
Lan is a kind-hearted person, she had a
pitiable past
Her parents passed away when she was
small, she married when she just got
over twenty
but then her husband died a few years
later
Leaving her nothing but this old flat and
its rent to live on
Lan always says, she didn't take up her
responsibility as a daughter when she
was young
and now she runs this elderly home
to compensate her fault
You seem to know her very well
You're a good friend of hers?
l've been patrolling this area for a long
time, it's just something l heard
9466, 9466 roger?
9466, send
6th floor, 24 Sring Alley
an old man has fainted, go check it out
9466 will go now
lt's Lan's place
What happen? Sir?
Lan, is there somewhere quiet that l can
take the witness report with you?
Somewhere quiet? lt's a small place here
come to my room
Don't touch anything
An old man goes 'home'!
Someone's dead and you're so happy?
l don't want you to feel sad
Everything is fine, l've got to work
Go back and take a rest
Play mahjong
Lan, this is Miss Wong, she's some to
see you
Miss Wong, Sir Lung has told me about
you
But l don't encourage those who don't
take care of their own elderly
The situation is, my uncle's family has
emigrated
l've got a resident here who takes care
of my elderly affairs
Why don't you have leave your name
and phone number
l'll ask him to call you back
Are you looking for Wing?
Yes, we are looking for Wing
You're so smart, Ming
Bring this lady to Wing, will you?
Sure
Really?
Smart kid
Lan, who is it this time?
The schoolmaster! This room
A bit small, but quite clean and tidy
Sir Lung, are you here to do the report
or renting a room?
The report, of course
lD please
Wong Mei Lan
What's the name of the schoolmaster?
Cheung Chi Choi
Cheung spelt as C H E U N G?
Yes
besides residents here
is there any man who would come here?
What does that have to do with this?
Someone's dead here, it's just routine
question
Wing whom lives upstairs?
Wing? He has already got a kid
What do you want to know?
Why are you ill? What's wrong?
l'm fine, it's just flu, thanks
Are you from the northe rn region?
Yes
Do you speak Mandarin?
l was born in Hong Kong
Any other question? Done?
Almost
Lan, you've got to see a doctor when
you're ill
Try Chinese medicine
Thank you
l'll see you off
Ming, you're not taking care of your
guest
go get a popsicle for the lady
Orange Flavor?
No thanks, Ming
lt's delicious, l'll get it for you
Am l bothering you with your work?
Of course not, just daily stuff
Ming/.,;'/.,;'/.,;' is very cute
Does Wing always leave Ming behind
like this
Just let him wander around?
Actually, l think, Ming really needs a
mother
Don't you think so?
Are you a vegetarian?
Your skin looks very soft and smooth
lt's for the lady
Which lady?
Kwan
Oh yes, Lan asked Ming to bring her to
see you
She's taking advantage of me again
My name is Wong, l/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'
Daniel Lee, where are you going?
East and West Road
Great
Yours, thank you
lt's my uncle
Let's walk back while you talk
Registered mail, yours
She's pretty
Quite a good match
Too tall
lf she is changing it to children's home
l don't think she'll take in any more
elderly
l think you'd better find another place for
your uncle
Thanks anyway
Who's in 3A
l know, fatty Cheung
OK, go
Ming's mother has gone to work?
She left him behind when he's only a few
months old
Cold blooded
lf there's a children's home here
then kids like Ming would be better off
Not really
Taking care children doesn't mean only
literally taking care of them
You need to have a loving heart, time
Are you married?
Are you married?
Yes
Got kids?
Not yet
Well, when you have kids
come see me then, l'll teach you
l'd better go
Keep in touch, bye
Bye
Stop fussing
lt's over a thousand dollars, we don't
have the money
Let's go
What did you say just now?
You're only a 4 years old baby
who taught you to talk like that?
Look who's talking?
How dare you
Kid, don't try to behave like an adult
You'll regret when you grow up
Look at your shoestring
Come, sit down
Didn't Wing teach you how to tie your
shoestring?
For whom?
For Lan
Lan took advantage of you?
No! it's a gift for Lan
Orchid bulbs, will grow orchid flowers!
How?
Lan knows how!
Bring this to her for me
Let's be partner
l'm making money, in the way you taught
me
You're good with foreign exchange
Piece of cake
easier than stocks
Don't be so serious! lt's just a game
You were not like that
l knew how to act then
l still have a kid to take care of
lf you come back and work
you can earn at least a hundred thousand
dollars per month
You can hire over ten Philippine maids
to look after him
lt's not like that
Fine
think carefully, call me any time
Cheers
What's up? What are you celebrating?
Wing, Wing, cheers
This suits, l wear for my company
He got a job at last
U-grade should bet a job with a suit
There's no future just sitting in shop
lt's a temp! For the time being!
What do you mean by temp? lt's a job
Let's eat
Wing, you've got letters
Letters?
Seems like some good news for Lan's
children's home
Yes!
Nosy body, l'm not telling you
Sir Lung, you're looking for me?
Where's Ming?
You're looking for Ming?
Seems like he's not back yet!
Mind didn't come today?
Probably not yet
Let him come back first, Ming
Sir Lung
Did you give it to Lan?
Sure! The orchid bulbs
What orchid bulbs? Those are water
lily bulbs
lt's too early for them; it's not Chinese
New Year yet
Oh? They are water lily bulbs
Bye now
Wait, wait
These flowerpot and soil, also suitable
lilies
Thank you!
Lan, the Foundation has a letter for you
They want to see you
Really?
But l'm ill/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'
OK, OK! lt's me anyway
You'd better rest more, you're still so ill
lt's not getting better
Whoever loses the race will wash
the dishes
One, two, three
l know l'd promised you the beach
but l've to do something important first
l'll come back and fetch you afterwards
l'll be back soon, OK
Wait for me, bye
Bye
Mr. Lee, please come in, Mrs. Leung
is expecting you
Come in, please sit down
l'm sorry about last time
l didn't explain clearly
lt's OK, you're only disguising to see
the truth
Here's the cheque
ls Lan's name correct?
lf not, l can write another one
There shouldn't be any problem
Actually, you've only see Lan once
what makes you believe in us?
When doing charity, one can't be so
calculative
l know she's sincere
Here are some documents, l need you
to fill in them
They're for lnland Revenue and Social
Welfare
No problem
Then Ming won't have to wander around
anymore?
That may not be so
you know, l travel a lot for work
and he has to follow me
Mrs. Leung, the security says that
this child was playing around downstairs
on his own
Thank you, lvy
Why are you here
That uncle brought me here
Brought you here
You brought him here and you left him
downstairs?
l didn't bring him, he follows me
Didn't l ask you to wait for me at home?
Did you promise to bring Ming to the
beach?
Wanna join us?
l don't know how to swim
We are not swimming
l want to show him something uncommon
lt's cloudy
Why were you so angry just now
Because of the sky, there're cloud
Why does that matter?
l'm not telling you
Actually, l think Ming needs another
l did whatever a mother do to a child
only except breast-feeding
To him, l'm both father and mother
Actually l don't think you are the kind of
person who does temp work
who can just let days by
l think you belong to Central
l know what you mean
l did that
Did what?
l did what you think l should do
Really?
Funds manager, the best
So, what can you say about life
But l do believe
as long as you don't give up, you'll
survive anyhow
Survive anyhow?
You heard of the crash
lt's just one afternoon, know how much
l lost?
Survive some how?
That's how you lost all your money?
Not my money, it's my clients' money
lf l'll have to pack back all the monies
a few more lifetime couldn't even be
possible
As for my money
l gave them all to my woman
Then you must love her very much
At that time, l thought she loves me more
than l do to her
She later found that
l wasn't the kind of man that she likes
Just like that
You're still young
You can start all over, anything will do
Besides, you've got Ming with you
Maybe it's because l lost someone whom
l wanna love
here comes someone who wanna me to
love
ls that right?
Burn more candles
Since then
whenever l can't sleep at night, l look at
the sky
That's why l started to fall in love
watching stars
Shooting stars
Really?
They are so beautiful
Yes so short-lived
Not really
lt's because they are so short-lived
that's why you find them brilliant and
beautiful
You're pretty too
but can you guarantee that you can be as
pretty life long?
Can you forever rely on makeup?
Let me tell you
l'm angry today because it's cloudy
and we can't see the shooting stars
Really? Where?
Northeast side
Then l can make a lot of wishes
See how greedy you are
l'm not greedy
Since you like stars so much
have you ever considered studying
astrology?
Have you heard of Greenwich?
Yes
That Observatory
They offered me a job there
Really?
Congratulations
When are you going then?
l don't know yet
Their living conditions
doesn't allow me to bring anybody along
That's impossible
Actually, l can get someone to take care
of Ming
He can then grow up in a better
environment
and you can go to do what you like
Let me think about it
Thanks for offering
See, shooting stars
lt's beautiful
lt's started
Ming can you see?
lt's beautiful
lt's beautiful
Cigarette? Show me
Superman
Where did you get this?
l just found it up there
Up there?
Don't play with fire anymore, superman
is fine
What a big mess?
Are we having a war?
Wing, how about this?
We've got lots already, and it's so dirty
Find something else
This book is much better
Sir Lung, just moved out, see if anything
suitable
Did you have the consent of the owner?
Can't be bothered! lt's not the first time
You go and take a look too
Wing, come out
What is it? Sir Lung
We never discriminate on what job a
person is doing
as long as he is earning with his own
ability
that he is not stealing from someone, right?
What do you want to say?
l hope you don't mind
l just thought whatever you do is fine
but Ming is only four years old
He has still got a long way to go
You shouldn't let him get used to
growing up amongst all these rubbish
and still feeling happy about it
Those kids, if their parents haven't been
working
they wouldn't let them to play around in
the rubbish
You should understand what l mean
Wing, you wanted feelings in things
you do
But Ming needs a future
Understand
Where did you find this?
l found it down there
So this is my company, all you can see
Good morning, Mr. Leung
You'll use this room for time being
Piece of cake
Let's go shopping after lunch, OK
Mr. Lee, l'm Eva,
just page me if you need me
Thank you
Daniel
We can put aside some food for Wing
Come on, let's eat
You're home
Mr. Lee, l'm lvy, Mrs. Leung's assistant
l met you at the office a few days ago
l've brought the contract for Lan to sign
and she told me to show you first
Ming was alone and there was nothing
to eat
l'm sorry to have taken so much of
your time
lt's OK, l called Mrs. Leung
she asked me to stay behind
Ming's hungry, Why don't you have
dinner first
l'm leaving
Wait a minute
Ming, can you tell this lady
Have l ever ignore you
and leave you with no dinner
lgnore me, no, without dinner, yes
l just remember that l have to go back
to the office
These stuff are too heavy
Bye now
Mrs. Leung
Kwan
Oh you're back
lvy told me that Ming has been waiting
for you for a whole day
l need to work for living , Miss lvy
Money just doesn't come running into
the house itself
But still you shouldn't leave a 4 years
old child at home alone
Don't you know that it's illegal
l know you wanted to be with the child
but a child need someone who can take
care of him
why don't you consider about sending
him to boarding school?
lt's OK, thank you
We're fine
Fine?
He doesn't even know how to take care
of a kid
l don't?
l've been taking care of him for 4 years
He's very happy
Only for the time being
Taking care of children is not only
making them happy
lt's not that difficult to make a child
l agree
Really?
You'll bring him away for 1 or 2 days
try taking care of him
and try to make him happy
Deal, just wait and see
How is it?
Let's watch TV
Shall we sleep early so that we can get
up early tomorrow and go out to play
l can't sleep so early
Don't be so boring?
Let's watch the stars
What shall l do, Dr. Chung?
You should relax and play with him
Play what?
l've no toys here
lt doesn't matter
ask him what he wants to play
use some imagination
a child can hold a pillow and think that
it's an airplane
This is a good opportunity to deal with
your fear
Call me if you need me
Thank you
Mrs. Leung, Maybe l bring Ming back
to my place tonight
Just the two of you?
l'll bring Ming out tomorrow
Where's Ming
We were watching stars just now
l'll go check there
No, he's not here
Ming, you scared me to death
l'm sorry, shouldn't have let the kid to
run around
lt's Ok, it's usual that a kid lost his way
Don't touch other people's thing
Come on
What is it? l wanna know
Use to talk with other uncles here
Good night! Mrs. Leung
Excuse me,
There's something l'd like to discuss with
you
Sir Lung
looking for Lan?
Can you give this to Lan for me
lt's fertilizer, for the lilies
Wing, tell Lan to try a few more doctors
Some doctors nowadays are not so
ethical
Why don't you tell her yourself
You know why
Got to go, thanks
Bye
Wing? lt's you?
Looking for Sir Lung?
He's gone
He gave you this fertilizer
He left so soon
Can l use your phone?
You must have forgotten the bill and have
your line disconnected
Brother Wah, it's wing
Any jobs these few days?
Remember to call me. OK
Hello, Brother Cha, it's Wing
Any boat that need to scrape the shells?
l'm available if you need me
Hello, Miss May, it's Wing
The one who delivers clothes
do you need someone to deliver your
clothes?
You didn't like it here?
You come out first, l'm tired
ls Ming missing his father?
Are you?
Wing was so fierce
Has him been like that before?
No
Maybe he's unhappy
Has Ming been unhappy before?
When l'm unhappy
Wing would try to make me happy again
How did he do it?
He sang to me
That's it, Wing would sing to Ming
Would Ming sing to him too?
Wing doesn't want me to sing!
He said l sang like a pig
and scared away everyone
You don't have to sing
You can be good and listen to him
Really?
lf you listen to me, l'll be very happy too
lf l'll listen to you and be good
will you tell Wing about it?
Look, Ming, let's go on board
Wing, Ming is going to steer the ship
lf you steer like this, all the people will die
To make a child happy is really not that
difficult
l'm sorry, l've bought him too much one
time
You just want to make him happy
Actually, Ming makes me happy
These two days there were the happiest
days l ever had
There's something l want to discuss with
you
didn't you say that you want go to
Greenwich
Maybe you can let Ming stay with me
then you can go and do what you can to
do
At the president suite
l can buy a house
somewhere close to you
l'm serious
l really like Ming a lot
why don't you think about it
You'd better rest, bye
Bye
Give it to us
You wan to rob me
Come on, one, two, three
Look! They're back
Stop

Tell me, who would look at the bottom
of car before driving?
What is it? What happened? Don't
quarrel
Sir Lung, you're right on time
This guy almost hit Lok
Luckily, it's just a few scratches only
Are you OK?
Wing, keep your eyes on Ming
You're not even doing the father's job
Everything is fine now
Hey, you've almost got me in trouble
Would you still dare to run around like
No
Would you dare not listening to me
No
lf ever l left you
would you dare following me?
Yes
Really?
Really
Do you know where Wing wants to go?
To the homes of the stars
Where's the home of the stars
There?
Yes
What's the name of that star?
l don't know
That is called BUULUU BUULUU star
What about that one?
That one is poo-poo star

What's that one?
Superman star

What's your profession?
He's just a temp worker, no steady job
nor steady income

Wee-wee first, you
You're not his father
Adopted father
Where's your proof that you can adopt
Read the back, it says clearly
He just picked him back
lt's clear
lllegal adoption, we've work to do here
What do you mean by illegal adoption
Didn't you say that you are going to help
him to apply for government aid?
And find a school for the child
That's another case
We have to deal with the legal matter
first
Colleagues, please prepare a report

charge this Mr. Lee here
Let's bring the kid to the Children
Protection Unit

the right and responsibility to do this
We're just doing our job
Leave alone, l just want my kid back
Please calm down, Mr. Lee
Go away
Just suppose that l didn't approach you
You'd better leave, you'll regret if you

You can't give him a future
Why do you hit me?
Let's go, don't scare the child
Give me back the birth certificate

Also, don't tell anyone what happened
Go now, Go
Hurry up
Bye, go

Sir, don't just chat, we're here to work
Hey you, Can't you see that l'm
investigating
Lee Siu Wing, where is Chan Kai Ming
now? Ming?
He's scared by them, and ran away
You have scared him away
You may search for awhile

leave
lt's possible, How can such a small kid
run away so fast
We'll search carefully
Sir, is this how you called investigation?
Just like this?
l don't need you to tell me what to do
Wing, if you see Ming you'll inform this
officer here
Give him your card, he needs to contact
you
Let's make things easier

Seems that he really dislikes you
Would you come with me to the Police
Station?
Let's go

Wing asked me to wait for him here
Lan is very ill
To bring Sir Lung to see me

Beside, his family didn't approach us for

Something must have happened

What about your meeting with the Mayor

Step aside, you're blocking my way

Sir Lung, Sir Lung/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'
You're here on time. lt's Lan
We are now waiting at the location
with ClD
we'll report with further information
Over
ls it this one?
Madam, what is it?

Someone reported a child being

Why are you here?
l've come to see a friend
May l take a look at the birth certificate

Wong Mei Lan

Almost
OK, now let's count together
Five, four, three two one
There's nothing
What? Look carefully
Wow, a big burning cake
Which we can't eat
Here, you can eat this one
Next year, when l have money
l'll buy you a birthday cake as big as
which we can eat. All right?
All right
Let's have this one now
close your eyes, make a wish
Are you done? Ming?
Not yet
How many wishes have you got?
Hey, what wish did you make?
Aren't you telling me?
Aren't you telling me?
Sir Lung
Ming, Happy Birthday
Lan has gone
Lan has gone to the other side of
the world
These few years, actually
l've been trying to find opportunities
to talk to her
but every time, we either ended up
getting nowhere, or quarreling
Such regrets
We didn't have even a chance
for hearty talk
How long have you known Lan?
We've quarreled for a few years
while l got this badge here
The first few years, l only dare watching
her from a distance
Life is so unpredictable
Let me tell you
l've applied to transfer to work
at another district
Lan is no longer here
l don't care about the order of
the area any more
What about us?
Yes, l'm selfish
For my whole life, l don't know
what l really like
and now, l don't even know
what to live for
For yourself
l don't know how to convince you
But there's always a tomorrow
after today
Think about it
lf everyone is like you
we'll have a happier world
You're right
There'll be fewer people committing
suicide
Educated person really talks differently
Of course
By the way, the whole police station
is looking for you
Do you remember, that lady?
The tall one, the one who's been
to your place?
She's the legitimate mother of Ming
Those writings behind the birth
certificate
she wrote them 4 years ago
Did she call the police?
No, it's that Welfare officer
He said he wanted to follow up the case
ln fact finding an excuse to get Ming
back to his mother
She left him behind 4 years ago
l know, l know you are very close
to Ming
Ming likes you a lot too
But when in the court
the priority is always with the mother
l don't know how to deal with these
complicated sentimental matters
Good luck
Although Ming is my own child
l don't know how to explain to him
that his mother left him behind
and didn't want him
To literally live with someone for 4 years
is not a short period
if l'm going to take Ming back now
l'm afraid that l might be hurting him
even more
l don't want to be wrong again
l've already arranged to have you
What have you arranged?
You left him four years ago
said you had an excuse
but if you are going to leave him
again now
you are definitely inhuman
l have been living with Ming for
four years
but still , l am not his father
l think Ming will be happier to stay
with you
Much happier
You can do it
Think about it
Give me a ring then
lt's hot
lt's broken here
No, it's not. Eat
lt's broken
l thought you like sausages
l do
You're going to bring ''Short-sighted''
only?
What about ''lcy''?
''lcy'' will keep you company
Keep me company?
All right. Be careful, it's hot
Delicious?
Yes
lt's hot, did you boil it?
Listen
When you go to your mom's place
you have to be as good as you are here
l know
You really do?
Yep
Want some egg?
lt's cold
l don't want it to burn you
Burn me?
Hurry up. When we finished eating
we'll go to wait for your mom, OK
Hold this
You! You just never tie your shoes
You have to learn to tie the shoestrings
properly
you're old enough to know how
Hear me?
This is the fish he likes. Call mom
Mom

Two points off the starboard bow,
in the fog bank.
What was it? A sail?
I don't know what it was.
Should we beat to quarters?

It was only for a moment.
I thought I saw a shape.
Did you see it, Mr Calamy?
No, sir.
Well, you did the right thing, Mr Hollom.
Go to your stations.
The deck's yours, Tom.
Sir.

Hold your position! Courage, now!
Hold steady, boys!
Don't worry, lads, we'll serve 'em out yet!
Mr Pullings, sir.
Davies, Jemmy, get Mr Pullings below.
Aye, sir.
Mr Blakeney, pass the word for the captain.
Clear the forward pin rails!
More sand on the floor!
On the up-roll... fire!
Down!
Relieving-tackles on the tiller!
You men, collect these wounded!
Keep 'em spitting, Mr Calamy.
Aye, sir. Reload and give 'em hell!
Sir! To the taffrail!
The rudder's shot away.
The steering don't answer, sir.
We're fish in a barrel.
Why are we not firing?
Let me through.
Here, Joe! Here!
Hold it in there!
He's on the larboard bow, sir.
Bring up your small arms!
Prepare to repel boarders.
Seize your weapons
and wait for the word.
Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes
over the stern and pull the boats in.
Put us in that fog, Tom.
Pull together, men!
Pull for the fog bank!
Run 'em out! Run 'em out!
Fire!
She's opened up a seam!
We need to get some oakum and pound it in.
Joe, a mallet and some irons!
She's gaining on us.
We're nearly there, boys!
Pull! Pull!
Reach for it, men!
We're home inside that fog!
Fire!
Pull for Lucky Jack!
We've done it!
Pipe down. Silence on deck.
They'll not find us in here!
Avast rowing.
Well done, lads.
Two feet six inches, sir... and holding.
Good work, Mr Lamb.
Thank you, sir.
So, what's the butcher's bill?
Nine dead, 27 wounded.
Joe Plaice.
He has a severely depressed fracture of
the skull. I don't think he'll see out the night.
Lord Blakeney.
Just a broken arm, sir.
Well, you're in very good hands.
I'm doing everything I can.
I know you were close to his father.
His father would've understood.
He knew the life. His mother, however...
Let me take a look at that brow of yours.
Damn, he was good.
Just came out of nowhere.
Hit us with a full broadside,
cut across our tail and took out our rudder.
Damn fine gunnery.
We only slipped away because of the fog.
Quite fortunate, really.
He may have had the weather gauge,
but we had the weather gods.
I have no idea what it is you're talking about,
but he did seem to come off rather well.
Seven weeks sailing, and he happens
in darkness on our exact position.
Well, the French have their spies
in England and elsewhere. As do we.
Indeed.
If he knew we were looking for him, he could
have stood to sea and passed well clear.
Well then, perhaps he was looking for us.
If she was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman!
It was an unfair match.
There was no dishonour in it.
She was more like a ship of the line.
You have to wonder about her hull.
Our shots wouldn't penetrate.
Triple-shotted at 200 yards - no effect.
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.
What is the weather gauge?
Shall I show you again, Stephen?
Not on the cloth!
It means she had the wind in her favour,
therefore control of the engagement.
And she had longer guns,
so she could hit us beyond our range.
The simple fact is we were soundly beaten.
Heavy frigate like that in the Pacific...
Could tip the war in Napoleon's favour.
By comparison, the Surprise
is a somewhat aged man-of-war.
Am I not correct?
Would you call me an aged man of war?
The Surprise is not old.
No one would call her old.
She has a bluff bow, lovely lines.
She's a fine sea boat, weatherly, stiff and fast.
Very fast, if she's well-handled.
No, she's not old.
She's in her prime.
We can patch up the main and mizzen.
Foresail's gone, so we'll bend our spare.
Mr Lamb is confident with basic repairs.
We can get home as we are.
We're not going home.
But to refit we need a port,
and the Acheron may be still looking for us.
We can refit at sea.
Here, where it shoals.
As you said, Mr Allen, she is taking the war to
the South Seas. We are supposed to stop her.
But, sir - with respect - she's a vastly
heavier ship. She's out of our class.
She could be halfway to Cape Horn
by the time we're repaired.
Well then, there's not a moment to lose.
Is it true they put the last stitch
through your nose?
What do you mean?
Joe said when you die, they stitch you in your
hammock with the last stitch in your nose,
just to make sure you're not asleep.
Not through the nose. You'll tell them?
It's all right.
It's just the laudanum speaking.
I've never seen a braver patient.
Poor darling.
Never mind, soon have you fixed up.
I want good work now.
I'll need two men into the starboard
forechannels. Roberts, Chadwick.
That's nice work there.
Repair won't do here.
I need these replaced.
Mr Calamy. There's something
might interest you here.
Look. The captain carved that.
When he was a mid, no more than your age.
He's known this ship man and boy.
He says there's enough of his blood in the
woodwork for the ship to almost be a relation.
I do understand your point, Mr Allen.
Your knowledge is beyond question.
However, a week in the Brazilian rainforest
looking for a new mast simply will not do.
The Acheron will be halfway to China.
Mr Lamb, as always, will do his best. Which
is all I can hope to expect from any man.
Is them his brains?
No, that's just dried blood.
Those are his brains.
Physician, he is.
Ain't one of your common surgeons.
Can I have the coin, please?
Sir.
He wouldn't look at you
for under ten guineas on land.
And he knows his birds and beasts.
You show him a beetle
and he'll tell you what it's thinking.
Back to work, you loafers!
Eckhart, use your pipe.
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.
You're not a pennyweight of use
gawpin' here!
Still hasn't said a word, sir.
Lord Blakeney. Feeling better?
Much better, thank you, sir.
Well, good. Good.
The doctor told me
you were fond of reading, so I...
It has all of his major battles
and some fine illustrations.
Thank you, sir.
Did you ever meet Lord Nelson, sir?
I had the honour of serving with him.
At the Nile. A great victory.
You can find it in here, actually.
Page 135, if I'm not mistaken.
Yes.
May I beg you to tell me
what kind of man he is?
You should read the book.
I will, sir. Thank you.
Here we go again.
Scrape-scrape, screech-screech.
Never a tune you could dance to,
not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.
How about this?
Or are you in the mood
for something more aggressive?
Salute.
Hats off.
What's all this about?
It's the phantom, sir.
Excuse me. That's what the men call it.
It's the Acheron, sir.
You see, Will here, he seen her being built.
But she's Yankee-built, sir.
He was getting married, and his wife's
second cousin works in the yards,
so Will here saw the ship out of water.
Sir, I saw there was something right strange
about her, so I asked Joe...
So he described it to me
and I knocked you up a model, sir.
And this framing is accurate?
Exactly accurate, sir.
Thank you, lads.
Thank you, sir.
Killick, an extra ration of rum for these men.
Thank you very much, sir.
Which I was saving for Salutin' Day.
We'll drink wine.
Oh, drink wine on Salutin' Day...
Bluff above the water and sharp below.
Gives the hull a finer entry and a long run
as she goes aft. That's why she's so fast.
Heavier, but fast despite it.
That's the future.
What a fascinating modern age we live in.
Planking and framing like that
would make her hull 2ft thick. Solid oak.
That's why we couldn't dent her. She's
probably capable of making 12 to 14 knots.
Now we know. Thank God for Warley
and his wife's second cousin.
She could be doing up to 280 miles a day.
Even if we did catch up with her...
I mean, to take her...
She's out of our class.
She's a 44-gun ship.
She's still vulnerable at the stern,
like the rest of us.
Hello, darling! How much for a kiss?
Quanto cost-o kiss-o?
Name?
My name is Maria.
Give us arrows. I give axe. Quick, mate.
Thank you, mate.
Gangway for the mail, please.
Here we are. Very important mail. Letters.
Era um navio francês.
What's he saying?
Estava indo pela costa?
Sim, estava. Indo pela costa ao sul.
A large man-of-war, French, stopped here
on the 10th, then headed south.
Muito grande.
Obrigado, senhor.
Somewhere here.
A full three weeks ahead.
All right, Tom, let's get all this squared away.
Aye, sir. Mr Hollar!
Let us complete our business here.
Put that woman down, Slade! This is a ship
of His Majesty's Navy, not a floating bordello!
All hands, get these provisions stowed.
Well done.
Gentlemen...
To wives and to sweethearts.
May they never meet.
Mr Howard, the bottle.
The bottle stands by you, sir.
Sir?
Excuse me, sir, but Mr Blakeney said that
you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.
Indeed. I was a young lieutenant,
not much older than you are now.
And Mr Pullings... Mr Pullings
was a snivelling midshipman,
still yearning for hearth and home.
Did you meet him, sir?
Can you tell me what he's like?
I have had the honour
of dining with him twice.
He spoke to me on both occasions.
A master tactician
and a man of singular vision.
He always said in battle..."Never mind
the manoeuvres, just go straight at 'em."
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great leader.
He's England's only hope
if old Boney intends to invade.
Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?
The first time that he spoke to me...
I shall never forget his words.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
He leaned across the table,
he looked me straight in the eye,
and he said "Aubrey...
may I trouble you for the salt?"
I've always tried to say it
exactly as he did ever since.
The second time...
The second time he told me a story...
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.
And he said no, he didn't need it.
That he was quite warm.
His zeal for king and country kept him warm.
I know it sounds absurd,
and were it from another man,
you'd cry out "Oh, what pitiful stuff"
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.
But with Nelson...
you felt your heart glow.
Wouldn't you say, Mr Pullings?
You did indeed, sir.
Well then, he would seem to be the exception
to the rule that authority corrupts.
To Lord Nelson.
To Lord Nelson.
Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?
I do.
Which would you choose?
Neither. There's no difference between them.
They're the same species of curculio.
If you had to choose.
If you were forced to make a choice.
If there was no other...
Well then, if you're going to push me...
I would choose the right-hand weevil.
It has significant advantage
in both length and breadth.
There, I have you!
You're completely dished.
Do you not know that in the service one must
always choose the lesser of two weevils?
He who would pun would pick a pocket.
Really! Weevils!
To the lesser of two weevils.
Yay, Joe!
Go on, Joe!
The Lord taketh...
and the Lord giveth away.
You hear that? He said something!
Doctor! He spoke, Doctor!
Well done indeed, Stephen.
Adieu to you Spanish ladies
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain
to sail for old England
to see you again
What a wonderfully true voice
Mr Hollom possesses.
Indeed.
Come, all you bold young thoughtless men
A warning take by me
And never leave your happy homes
to sail the raging sea
Looks like a frigate!
We must turn and fight.
But he has the weather gauge again.
He must've been watching us
from some inlet.
My God. What can we do?
He has us by the hip.
Run like smoke and oakum.
We'll have to bend every sail.
We'll put up our handkerchiefs if we have to!
We must survive this day.
Let's get about it. Mr Allen, gentlemen.
All hands, make sail!
This is the second time he's done this to me.
There will not be a third.
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel
of that there phantom ship.
You better hold fast.
What is it with this man?
Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps?
His boy, God forbid?
He fights like you, Jack.
Bring the sun down to the horizon.
When its lower limb is touching the horizon...
Williamson, look to your sextant!
When the orb is no longer rising...
then it has reached its zenith
and that would be noon.
Sir?
Mr Pullings.
Do you make noon, Mr Hollom?
Yes, sir.
Call noon. It's your class.
Mr Nichols, make that twelve.
Six hours?
Five at most.
Just keep us out of her reach until nightfall.
She's to look like us, lads, don't forget.
Jibbo, make fast those whips.
We didn't want to make it any taller,
on account of this wind.
Excuse me, sir, but what are they building?
Your first command.
Take the weight on the yard tackles.
Fend her off, fend her off.
Lower away on the main.
Wouldn't want to lose you.
Aye, sir.
There's a painter. Pass her aft.
Outside everything, mind.
Lively now.
We've not ten minutes before he's up with us.
Mind what the captain told you.
Pull, boys. That's it.
Now.
Killick there! Douse your light.
Mr Allen, make ready.
Hello. We caught a fish.
Now, tell me that wasn't fun.
Yes, sir.
Hard a'larboard!
Stand the men down, Mr Pullings.
I'll take this watch.
Aye, sir.
Mr Mowett, Mr Allen, calmly now.
You know his orders.
Well done, sir.
She's a right phantom, she is. The way
she come up again, right behind us like that.
Out of nowhere. And right behind us.
Like that first time, out the fog.
With our shot bouncin' off her.
Captain's not called Lucky Jack for no reason.
Phantom or no, she's a privateer,
and Lucky Jack'll have her.
You need more than luck 'gainst a phantom.
Is she like a pirate?
No, they're not pirates, Lofty.
Oh, no. If they were,
we could hang them when we catch 'em.
Privateer gets a piece of paper
from the Frenchies
says they can hunt down
anything with our flag.
They go after rich merchantmen and the like.
Hey, but think on our share
of the prize money.
She'll be loaded with gold
and ambergris and all the gems of Araby.
That's all very well, Nagle.
Got to get home to spend it, but.
Never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.
And I've never met a live one
that you bought one for, neither.
Sitting up all night, catching your death
of cold. That's the last of the coffee, too.
Thank you, Killick.
Bonden.
That's enough easting.
Set a course sou'-sou'west.
Aye, sir. Sou'-sou'west.
Sail!
Two points off starboard bow!
Three cheers for Lucky Jack!
She's ours, boys!
Set royals and courses.
Sir.
Have the idlers placed along the rails.
I've never seen the like.
It has to be more than 100 sea miles
and he brings us up on his tail.
That's seamanship, Mr Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.
Told you it would work, Will.
We'll have them by nightfall.
I think we've got him, sir.
And the wind favours us this time.
Don't count your eggs
before they're in the pudding.
Still, if we can close this gap
and get up behind her, she may well be ours.
Touch wood. Scratch a stay.
Turn three times.
May the Lord and saints preserve us.
Turn!
Move along, man.
We'll have lost him before you rig it up!
Hold!
12 knots, sir.
That's 12 knots. That's good.
I want more. Have all the spare hands
placed on the windward rail.
Mr Hollar. Rouse up the off-watch.
All hands on starboard rail!
Come up the larboard topsail sheets!
We're crackin' on!
We'll be crackin' up if he don't watch it!
Captain knows this ship.
He knows what she can take.
Arh!
Mr Hollar!
Mr Hollar, I want lifelines fore and aft!
No lounging, boy!
Double-grape that launch!
Cape Horn, Doctor.
Close the lid.
There's enough water in the grog.
Thank you for that, Davies.
Reckon the captain will follow him
round the Horn, every stitch of canvas flying?
I reckon he'd follow him to the gates of hell.
It's a devil ship, I tell ya.
And it's leadin' us right into a trap.
She's making a run for the Horn, sir.
I'll not vouch for this mast.
Not around the Horn.
Thank you. Your comments
will be noted in the log.
Sail trimmers to their stations!
Get the sails off her, lads. She's over-pressed.
Give 'em a pull and belay!
We're closing on her, Tom.
I'll not give up now.
Come up on the wind, Barret.
Set a course sou'west by west.
Sou'west by west, sir.
Mr Calamy.
Idlers and waisters below.
We're for the Horn, boys!
Close reef topsails!
Lively, lads!
Batten down those hatches
before we're on the bottom!
Johansson, Truelove! To the mizzen!
All secure.
Down ye go, lads.
Mr Hollom, help young Warley
on the mizzen topgallant.
I'll need more men, sir.
Yes. Go.
Mr Hollom, sir! Help me!
Tudor, Ellers! To Mr Allen!
You men, lay aloft.
The mizzen topgallant. Light along!
Help!
Help me!
Man overboard!
Mizzen's gone! Hands to the taffrail!
He's over there, sir!
Swim for the wreckage, man!
Swim, man!
Over here!
Mr Allen, gratings and barrels,
anything that floats, overboard.
She's broaching! We're losing her!
Sir, the wreckage is acting as a sea anchor!
We must cut it loose!
It's going to sink us!
Sir, he's going to make it! He can do it!
Come on, Will!
Come on! Hand over hand!
For God's sake, Will, swim!
Swim for the wreckage, Will!
Swim! Come on!
Come on, Will! Swim!
He's been at it again.
Who's that, then?
The Jonah.
The deaths in actual battle
are the easiest to bear.
For my own part, those who die under my
knife, or from some subsequent infection...
I have to remind myself that it was
the enemy that killed them, not me.
That young man was a casualty of war.
As you said yourself,
you have to choose the lesser of two evils.
Weevils.
The crew will take it badly.
Warley was popular.
Have they expressed
any feelings on the matter to you?
Jack, before answering,
I'm compelled to ask,
am I speaking with my old friend
or to the ship's captain?
To the captain I'd say
there's little I detest more than an informer.
Now you're talking like an Irishman.
I am an Irishman.
Well, as a friend, then.
As a friend, I would say that I have never once
doubted your abilities as a captain.
Speak plainly, Stephen.
Perhaps we should have
turned back weeks ago.
The men... of course
they would follow Lucky Jack anywhere,
rightfully confident of victory.
But therein lies the problem.
You're not accustomed to defeat.
And chasing this larger, faster ship with
its long guns is beginning to smack of pride.
It's not a question of pride.
It is a question of duty.
Duty. Yes, I've heard it well spoken of.
Be as satiric as you like. Viewing the world
through a microscope is your prerogative.
This is a ship of war. I will grind whatever
grist the mill requires to fulfil my duty.
Whatever the cost?
Whatever the cost.
To follow orders with no regard for cost.
Can you really claim there's
nothing personal in this call to duty?
Orders are subject
to the requirement of the service.
My orders were to follow him as far as Brazil.
I exceeded my orders a long time ago.
Got it.
The wind's backing, sir.
Sir, we just can't hold
this westerly course any longer.
If we can't sail through the damn wind, Tom,
we'll bloody well sail around it. Due south.
How far south, sir?
As far as is necessary, Mr Pullings.
Aye, sir.
Lively!
Due south, please, Mr Bonden.
Due south, sir.
Heave! Steady!
Hurray!
Clearly something nautical and fascinating
just happened. I am at a loss.
We have made our turn northward.
We are headed back toward the sun.
To the sun.
To the sun!
Oh, and by way of anticipation of this event,
I have asked Killick
to prepare something special.
Killick! Killick there...
I'm already here, ain't I?
Gentlemen, I give you...
our destination.
It's the Galápagos Islands!
The Galápagos Islands!
Our whaling fleet is there.
And their cargo would put a pretty penny
into old Bones-aparte's invasion purse.
That's where the Acheron will be.
Sure as there's carts to horses.
So, Mr Pullings, if you'll permit me...
a slice of Albemarle.
And for you, Doctor, Redondo Rock.
Perfect.
And the Acheron... for me.
Let the waters roar, Jack
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack
Don't forget your old shipmates
Folly-rolly-rolly-rolly-rye-o!
We have worked the selfsame gun
Quarterdeck division
Sponger I, and loader you
Through the whole commission
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack
Don't forget your old shipmates
Folly-rolly-rolly-rolly-rye-o!
The Enchanted Isles. They're said
to be full of strange and wonderful beasts.
When we get there,
we'll have to stop for food and water.
I promise you, during that time -
several days at least -
you can wander at will, collecting bugs
and beetles to your heart's content.
You'll be the first naturalist
to set foot on the islands, I'll wager.
Well, I would like that of all things.
Is it an insect?
Yes.
Doesn't look like one.
I mean, it looks like a stick.
Yes, that's the whole point.
It's disguised itself in order to survive.
See, there's a spider
that's disguised itself as an ant.
And here's an insect that's taken on the shape
of a thorn to save itself from the birds.
Did God make them change?
Does God make them change?
Yes, certainly.
But do they also change themselves?
Now that is a question, isn't it?
Sir! Sir, we've raised the Galápagos!
I'm coming!
Look. Beyond the rock.
Oh, yes, I see.
What is it? Curious, eh?
Some type of gull?
There's an ugly devil.
Disgusting! It's got warts all over it.
Ugly devils, aren't they?
I can't see any women.
Just ducks and lizards.
What, no women? It ain't natural.
How extraordinary.
What is, sir?
Those birds. They're a species of cormorant,
but they are flightless.
Do you see their underdeveloped wings?
By all that's holy,
I think that's unknown to science.
The dragons don't seem to bother them.
No. They're a type of iguana, I should think.
Therefore, they're vegetarian.
Will you catch one?
A pair of them, I should think.
Then you can present
one of their offspring to the king.
Look. There's one going for a swim.
Iguanas don't swim.
These ones do.
Well, I'll be damned.
Two new species in as many minutes.
That's remarkable.
All hands about ship! Off tacks and sheets!
Prepare the mainsail to haul!
Aubrey.
Hogg. Master of the Albatross.
God bless you, Captain.
God bless you all.
Mr Calamy, food and water for these men.
Aye, sir.
Mr Howard, stand your men down.
Royal Marines, trail arms!
We was coming back for fresh lines
no more than a week ago.
Hid in that inlet yonder. Burnt our bloody
ship to the waterline. Fucking pirates!
Crew prisoner, captain dead.
She were a big black three-master.
Break your heart, it would.
£12,000 sterling of the finest grade oil they
took. We been out more than two years, see.
And her course?
Maybe a point south of west,
following the rest of the fleet.
Mr Pullings, enter these men's names
into the ship's books.
Mr Allen, set a course. West by south.
All hands, make sail!
Sir, should we not take on fresh provisions?
Mr Mowett, there's not a moment to lose.
Jack, have you forgotten your promise?
Subject to the requirements of the service.
I cannot delay for the sake
of an iguana or a giant peccary.
Fascinating, no doubt,
but of no immediate application.
There is, I think, an opportunity here
to serve both our purposes.
As I understand it, this is a long, thin island.
You need to sail around it.
I could walk across it.
I have known you to spend hours
staring into a deserted bird's nest.
I could walk briskly, pausing only
for important measurements.
Making discoveries that could advance
our knowledge of natural history.
If wind and tide had been against us,
I should have said yes.
They're not. I'm obliged to say no.
Oh, I see.
So after all this time in your service,
I must simply content myself
to form part of this belligerent expedition,
hurry past wonders, bent on destruction.
I say nothing of the corruption of power...
You forget yourself, Doctor.
No, Jack, no.
You've forgotten yourself. For my part,
I look upon a promise as binding.
The promise was conditional.
I command a king's ship, not a private yacht!
We do not have time for
your damned hobbies, sir!
All right. All right.
Get those fish below.
Sluice down this deck.
Get them below.
Mr Blakeney.
Sir, I found a curious beetle
walking along the deck.
I think it's a Galápagos beetle.
I'm sure of it.
Were you to walk all day on the island,
you might never come across it.
Yes, that is more than likely sure.
You can have it, sir.
Mr Blakeney.
Thank you.
Sir.
Last gun fired, sir.
Two minutes and one second, sir.
Lads, that's not good enough.
We need to fire two broadsides to her one.
Want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?
Do you want to call Napoleon your king?
No!
Want your children to sing The Marseillaise?
No!
Mr Mowett, Mr Pullings, starboard battery!
Jump to it, lads. Cadence and rhythm.
Mark your targets!
Come on, lads, faster now!
Come on, swab it!
Heave!
Report, Mr Mowett.
Third and fourth divisions ready.
Right. Starboard battery, fire!
One minute and ten seconds!
Well done, lads.
Extra grog for all of you.
Gangway for the captain, lads.
Marked improvement, Mr Calamy. Well done.
Thank you, sir.
Killick! Killick there!
What do you have for us tonight?
Which it's soused hog's face.
Which it is soused hog's face!
My favourite. My favourite.
the Surprise will blow her to kingdom come!
One more week of this and
they'd give it up for a cup of water.
I can't make it rain.
I can harness the wind,
but I ain't its goddamn creator.
I have never known such a run of bad luck.
"And they said unto him
For what caused the evil?"
Where'd that come from?
It's from the Bible, that. That is
from the Bible. The story of the Jonah.
They found out on their ship
that one of their men - this Jonah cove -
he'd offended God
and was the cause of all their bad luck.
Evil comes... from him
who evil thinks and evil is.
No, no. Joe knows a thing or two about evil.
From personal experience. Right, Joe?
It's like Killick says. Morning of the battle,
he doesn't have the guts to beat to quarters.
Then his entire gun crew's killed.
Soon as he went up the mizzen, Will falls.
And whose watch was it
when we lost our wind?
You there! Stand fast!
Master-at-arms, take that man below
and clap him in irons.
Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.
Aye, sir.
Bring Hollom down to my cabin.
A man pushed past you,
yet you said nothing. Why?
I intended to, sir, but the right words didn't...
The right words?
He was deliberately insubordinate.
I've tried to get to know the men, sir,
and be friendly,
but they've taken a set against me.
Always whispering when I go past
and giving me looks.
I'll set that to rights.
I'll be much tougher on them.
You don't make friends
with the foremastjacks, lad.
They'll despise you in the end,
think you weak.
Nor do you need to be a tyrant.
No, sir.
I'm very sorry, sir.
You're, what? 26, 27?
I'm 30 next Friday, sir.
You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice.
I know you have, but you're not a bad sailor.
You can't spend your life a midshipman.
No, sir. I will try much harder, sir.
Look, Hollom, it's leadership they want.
Strength.
Now, you find that within yourself,
and you will earn their respect.
Without respect,
true discipline goes by the board.
Yes, sir. Um...
Strength, respect... and discipline, sir.
Well... it's an unfortunate business, Hollom.
Damned unfortunate.
That'll be all.
Yes, sir.
I am not a flogging captain.
for all the bad luck,
real or imagined, on this voyage.
Mr Lamb? If you please.
These men are exhausted.
You've pushed them too hard.
Stephen, I invite you
to this cabin as my friend.
Not to criticise nor to comment
on my command.
Well, shall I leave you until
you're in a more harmonious frame of mind?
What would you have me do?
Tip the ship's grog over the side.
Stop their grog?
Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom.
Stop 200 years of privilege and tradition.
I'd rather have them three sheets to the wind
than face a mutiny.
I'm rather understanding of mutinies.
Men pressed from their homes, confined
for months aboard a wooden prison...
I respect your right to disagree with me,
but I can only afford one rebel on this ship.
I hate it when you talk of the service
in this way. It makes me so very low.
You think I want to flog Nagle?
A man who hacked the ropes
that sent his mate to his death?
Under my orders?
Do you not see? The only things that keep
this wooden world together are hard work...
Jack, the man failed to salute.
There's hierarchies even in nature.
There is no disdain in nature. There is no...
Men must be governed!
Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.
That's the excuse of every tyrant in history,
from Nero to Bonaparte.
I, for one, am opposed to authority.
It is an egg of misery and oppression.
You've come to the wrong shop
for anarchy, brother.
Four.
Five.
Seven.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
Shh. Not so loud.
Oh, put that dirk down, Boyle.
You OK, Mr Hollom?
He's not ill, just dodging work as usual.
You shut up.
Just leave him be.
Have some water.
Oh, thank you.
Sir. Sir, it's Mr Hollom.
There's nothing physically wrong with him.
He thinks he's been cursed.
Sailors can abide a great deal,
but not a Jonah.
My God. You believe it too.
Not everything is in your books, Stephen.
The Jonah.
He's causing it.
He's callin' it up, don't you see?
Every time he's on watch, that ship appears.
You wait and see.
Any time tonight,
that ghost ship's gonna turn up.
And it's gonna take us all with it,
straight down to the hot place.
Mr Hollom.
You gave me such a start.
Are you feeling better now?
Yes. Much better, thank you.
The captain thinks
we'll get our wind tomorrow.
I'm sure of it.
You've always been very kind to me.
Goodbye, Blakeney.
The simple truth is, not all of us become
the men we once hoped we might be.
But we are all God's creatures.
If there are those among us
who thought ill of Mr Hollom,
or spoke ill of him,
or failed him in respect of fellowship...
then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord.
And we ask for his.
God be praised. Mr Mowett?
Avast there!
Doctor, have you seen the bird?
What sort of bird?
Some sort of albatross. Either that, or
he's a prodigious great mew. There it goes.
There he is. My bird, my bird. Damn!
It's circling, lads!
Doctor?
My God! Doctor! Doctor!
I'm so sorry, man.
The bird dropped low. I didn't see you.
Calamy, get Higgins.
I'm fine, Jack.
The bullet took in a piece of shirt with it.
Unless it's removed,
it's gonna suppurate and fester.
Are you equal to the task?
Well, I'll need to read up on the doctor's
books, like. Study some pictures he has.
Study some pictures?
It's just to get my bearings, that's all.
Well, it'd be a lot easier if I were on dry land.
You know, you wouldn't have the...
I'll manage. You'll see.
Sail on the horizon, sir. Running west.
We're not sure, but we think it's her, sir.
Better get...
Goodbye, sir.
Shall we beat to quarters, sir?
Tell me this wasn't on my account.
No, not at all.
I just needed to stretch my legs.
Gently there.
Briskly now. Secure this line.
Royal Marines posted every 20 yards, sir.
All set, Higgins?
Yes, sir.
No.
I do this with my own hand.
If everything is under control,
I'll just be outside.
wouldn't go amiss.
That is, if, of course, you have
the constitution for this kind of thing.
My dear doctor, I have been amongst
and around wounds all my life.
Well, good, then.
Put your hand on my belly,
pressing firmly when I give the word.
Higgins, the catling, if you please.
Padeen, please.
The sounder, Mr Higgins.
Swab.
All right.
Mr Higgins, you'll have to raise the rib.
Take a good grip... with the square retractor.
And lift up.
Swab, Jack. I can't see.
Are you all right?
I got it.
A tad more pressure.
Is that all of it?
Aye, sir.
She'll patch up nicely.
Thank God I got it.
Oh, that's good.
Sir! Sir!
Padeen and I have been collecting for you.
Have you really?
The beetles each come with a specimen
of the plant they were found on.
Padeen, that one's got away.
Sir, I've made a few notes,
if you want to see them.
Mr Blakeney, it would appear that
you have the makings of a naturalist.
Well, sir, perhaps I could combine them to be
a sort of... fighting naturalist, like you, sir.
They don't combine too well, I find.
Should you really be getting up, sir?
Mr Blakeney, are you also a doctor?
No, sir.
No, you're not. Padeen, if you please.
How long does the captain
intend that we stay? Do you know?
Oh, a week perhaps.
A week?
There's no great hurry.
Mustn't we make haste for the Marquesas?
I'm not even sure
it was the Acheron we sighted.
And if it was, she'll be well away by now.
Like looking for an honest man in parliament.
No, we shall head home. Before peace
breaks out with France, God forbid.
I fear you may have burdened me
with a debt I can never repay.
Tosh. Name a shrub after me.
Something prickly and hard to eradicate.
A shrub? Nonsense.
I'll name a great tortoise after you.
Testudo aubreii.
Come on, pack up your things.
We should be going.
Back to camp, sir?
No, to the other side of the island.
But, sir, that must be at least ten miles.
Then there's not a moment to lose.
That's where I saw my flightless cormorant.
Come on.
Seven inches in length.
Four inches wide.
15-inches-Iong neck.
Width at the widest point... six inches.
Padeen, put the net down
and use your hands. They won't bite.
Here's a good one.
Pick them up carefully.
Sir, I think we should be getting back.
Naval discipline doesn't operate out here,
Mr Blakeney. I must find that cormorant.
And should it indeed prove flightless,
you can join me at the Royal Society dinner
as co-discoverer.
Mr Blakeney.
Sir, we must hurry.
Padeen, you must carry him. Put those down.
Leave them. Just put everything down.
Open the cages.
All hands, unmoor ship!
Mr Allen, I'll have her on a starboard tack.
Let's have hands to stow these tortoises.
Barret Bonden,
put your helm hard to starboard.
He has a head start of two hours on us
and he's bearing south.
That can only mean King Charles Island.
He's looking for water.
If we caught up with her, I mean, to take her...
we'd have to be bloody invisible.
So, Stephen, did you get to see your bird?
No. Well, yes, but I couldn't catch one.
No, my greatest discovery
was your phantom.
Indeed it was. I'm sorry you had to leave
the majority of your collection behind.
In actual fact, Mr Blakeney and I
did make one... very interesting find.
Is that right?
Let me guess. A stick?
Tell him about it, Mr Blakeney.
It's a rare phasmid, sir.
It's an insect that disguises itself as a stick
in order to confuse its predators.
A nautical phasmid, Doctor.
At least, to a hungry eye,
if one has an appetite for whalers.
I intend to take a greater interest
in the bounty of nature from now on.
I had no idea that a study of nature
could advance the art of naval warfare.
Oh, I see.
Now to pull this predator in close
and spring our trap.
Yes.
You're the predator.
There. Hull-down,
broad off the larboard bow.
That's a frigate, all right.
Damn, you've got good eyes, Barret.
Mr Allen! More smoke.
Aye, sir!
That'll bring 'em about.
That's it, lads. Clean 'em up
so they fly straight and true.
Let's have fresh flints in all the locks.
unship your rear wheels.
Drop the gun.
Come on, Killick, you too. Get dressed.
Oh, God!
Tom?
Our preparations are completed, sir.
Good. Right, from now on
no "sirs", no salutes, no whistles, no bells.
Aye, sir.
Yes, I think we're all
finding that quite difficult.
There'll be 30 or more whalers
locked in the Acheron's hold.
After we board, Mr Calamy
should take a party and free them.
You think him ready, sir?
Were you ready, Tom?
He may well turn the tide.
Indeed, sir.
She's taken the bait. Let's come about.
Make a show of fleeing, panicky
and disorganised, like a whaler might.
Present company excepted, Mr Hogg.
Hurry up, or they'll see you.
Eckhart, leave that. Just come up quick
and get some whaler's slops on.
Congratulations. Acting third lieutenant.
Thank you.
I hear we're to free the whalers.
You're to be stationed on the quarterdeck.
I'm sorry, Will.
Make a bad show of keeping your course.
Let her run up and luff every now and then.
Excuse me, sir.
Remove your hat. We're whalers.
Mr Calamy says I'm not
on the boarding party. I wanted to say...
I know what you want to say.
And my answer is no.
You'll lead your gun crew, then when
we board, you'll take command of the ship.
Do I make myself clear?
Take command of the ship... Thank you, sir.
Back to your station.
Yes, sir.
On your right upper arm,
to tell friend from foe!
Davies, this arm. Starboard arm.
Is that the arm you got or don't got?
Less of that cheek, Davies.
Take your neck cloths
and put them round your right upper arm.
Make way for the captain.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Right, lads.
I know there's not a faint heart among you,
and I know you're as anxious as I am
to get into close action.
But we must bring him right up beside us
before we spring this trap.
That will test our nerve.
And discipline will count
just as much as courage.
The Acheron is a tough nut to crack.
More than twice our guns and numbers.
And they will sell their lives dearly.
Topmen, your handling of the sheets
to be lubberly and un-navylike,
until the signal
to spill the wind from our sails.
This will bring us almost to a complete stop.
Gun crews, you must run out and tie down
in double-quick time.
With the rear wheels removed you've gained
elevation, but without recoil you can't reload.
So, gun captains, that gives you one shot
from the larboard battery. One shot only.
You'll fire for her mainmast.
Much will depend on your accuracy.
However, even crippled she will still
be dangerous, like a wounded beast.
Captain Howard and the marines
will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun
and musket fire from the tops.
They'll try and even the odds for us
before we board.
They mean to take us as a prize.
And we are worth more to them undamaged.
Their greed... will be their downfall.
England is under threat of invasion.
And though we be on the far side
of the world, this ship is our home.
This ship is England.
So it's every hand to his rope or gun.
Quick's the word and sharp's the action.
After all, surprise is on our side.
Toss them high so they can see them.
Hello, Doctor.
Care for a cigar?
Thank you, no.
If you please, Doctor.
I took the liberty, Doctor.
Thank you, Killick.
There's three lumps in there.
How kind.
Good luck, Will.
Good luck, Peter.
See you afterwards.
And you.
Steady now, lads. Keep calm.
English whaler Syren, this is Acheron.
Barret.
Sir.
You have no possibility, no chance.
But you have had warning.
Stop now, or we will destroy your ship.
English whaler, this is your last warning.
Stop now, or we will destroy you.
Let fly!
Let fly!
Haul your yards there!
C'est un navire de guerre!
Run out, boys!
Fire!
Fire!
For the mainmast, lads!
Let me through.
Fire!
Hard a-larboard!
Right the headsails! Set the topsails!
Heave!
Man the starboard battery!
Fire as she bears!
Get to it! Get to it!
It's the fallen mast! We can't lay alongside.
Cross the wreckage as best you can.
I'll draw their fire.
Huzzah for Lucky Jack!
Grappling hooks away!
Run out the boarding planks!
My division, follow me!
For England, for home, and for the prize!
Here we go, lads!
Pipe down. Silence.
Looks like the job is done, sir.
Acheron!
Fire!
Mr Blakeney, the nine-pounder!
Fire!
Keep moving, men! Keep moving!
Joe!
Grenades, ready!
They're aiming for our hull!
They could sink us! Depress the muzzle!
Padeen, train it aft!
Together now!
Stand clear!
Fire!
Arm yourselves! We must board them!
Follow me!
Now!
Whalers, follow me!
Mr Hogg, down below! Quickly now!
Albatrosses! Albatrosses, do you hear me?
To the guns! To the guns!
Boyle, douse that gun's priming!
Lively there! Come on! Move!
Now do your worst!
Non! Non! Non!
Mr Howard.
Sir.
Have they struck their colours?
I believe so.
Has their captain been sighted?
Not yet, sir.
Carry on.
Aye, sir.
Le capitaine?
L'infirmerie.
Docteur? Docteur?
Docteur de Vigny, monsieur.
I did what I could for him.
Before the capitaine died...
he said I was to give you this.
No. I'll do it.
Can you help me?
Our Father,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,
forever and ever.
Amen.
Robert Gardner, able seaman.
James Lloyd, boatswain's mate.
Robert Kemp, able seaman.
John Antonio, quartermaster's mate.
Michael Doudle, able seaman.
Joseph Nagle, carpenter's mate.
John Allen, sailing master.
Peter Miles Calamy...
lieutenant.
We therefore commit
their bodies to the deep,
to be turned into corruption,
looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead,
and the life of the world to come,
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.
It's our old friend.
Pass down a barrel of paint, please.
Sir, the whalers are all aboard
and that's the last detachment of marines.
Good, good.
I think I shall return to the Galápagos.
Take on food and water and give
the doctor a few days to find his bird.
Very good, sir.
You, however,
shall take the Acheron south to Valparaíso.
Parole the prisoners there, refit as necessary,
and we shall rendezvous in Portsmouth.
I believe Mr Hogg
would be a good choice for sailing master.
However, that will be your decision,
Captain Pullings.
Your orders.
Thank you, sir.
Godspeed, Tom.
And to you, sir.
Mr Mowett?
With pleasure, sir.
Good luck.
See you in Portsmouth.
Now, lads, huzzah for Captain Pullings!
Good luck, Captain.
Oh, here we go again.
Which it will be ready when it's ready!
I'll rest easier when I know
they've reached shore.
So many wounded, and only that poor
unfortunate Higgins to tend to them.
Still, he's better than no doctor at all.
I met their doctor. I spoke to him.
No, he died of fever months ago.
De Vigny?
Pass the word for Mr Mowett.
Mr Mowett to the great cabin.
Their "doctor" gave me this sword.
Sir.
Mr Mowett, change of course.
Southeast by east.
We'll intercept the Acheron
and escort them into Valparaíso.
Aye, sir. Sou'east by east.
And William...
Sir?
Beat to quarters.
Very good, sir.
Subject to the requirements of the service.

It's already been 6 months
since Hee went into hiding.
Maybe she was taken back
due to the risk of exposure.
I dreamt about U2 last night.
He said he'd busted Hee.
Goodbye....
You know this song?
I don't like music.
You know that, don't you?
September 1998 Seoul
May I help you?
I was having a little chat
with my buddies.
About what?
Love.
They say love's to stay together
until the last moment.
They know the pain of separation.
I bet they do,
seeing each other sold off.
Have you ever seen fishes cry?
How do they cry?
Cry in the water,
then you'll know how.
You're about the same size...
as my boyfriend.
Have you ever seen fishes laugh?
No.
It's already been a year.
It was raining then, too.
You came back the next day
to buy a fish bowl...
...with a CD for me.
I said, ''May I help you...''
Yeah, you said ''Anapus''
instead of ''Anabus''.
A total stranger
gave me a CD I really liked.
It was coincidental, but...
...you felt so close
as if I'd known you for a long time.
Did you go to the
Alcohol Cessation Class today?
The doctor said that
I no longer had to come.
Take a guess.
You're unbelievable!
They're 'Kissingurami.'
Kissingurami...
If one of them dies,
the other dies, too.
They dry up from malnutrition
or their scales fall off.
Don't let them die.
Feed them once a day...
...and change the water...
Every 5 days.
They don't survive
where it's dark and cold.
Keep the lights on all the time.
I might do the same thing
if you left me alone.
Kissingurami.
Breaking news.
Under the slogan of
'Reunification of two Koreas,'
A team of North and South
for the World Cup 2002...
...was launched earlier today.
A friendly game will be
held on the 25th...
...not only to pick players
for the team...
...but to mark a turning point in history...
...where the two leaders of South
and North Korea get together.
The president of Korea Football
Organization said...
...the game would speed up
the reconciliation of the two Koreas.
Yes?
We were supposed to meet.
Change of plans.
The 3rd floor, electronics.
What happened?
Not clear yet.
Any barrier?
Around the third block.
Take the outside!
Calm down.
I'm a secret agent.
Dead end on 4th street.
Against the wall!
Why did you run?
She was there.
She knew about our rendezvous.
Who?
Where?
He's down!
It's a lovely Wednesday
when our fish take a bath.
It's a lovely Wednesday
when our fish take a bath.
Please don't put ashes into
the fish bowl.
My goldfish smokes, too.
Dr. Min, Identified
It's a lovely Wednesday
when our fish take a bath.
Hey, oddball!
Lim was the head
of black-market weapons dealers.
We knew nothing
about his organization.
When'd he call you?
Right before I called you.
The perpetrator was there
at the same time.
Considering the fact that
he was hit at the scene...
...he wasn't being followed.
Otherwise, he would've been
killed before the rendezvous.
My life is on the line.
I'll tell you the details later
but it's about my client...
...who is onto something
very dangerous.
Let me tell you again.
If you don't protect me....
His life was being threatened
during the weapons deal.
Our priority is to find out
who his client was.
We went to meet him
right after the call.
The big question is...
...how'd this client know
we were meeting?
Autopsy reports came out.
It's Wednesday.
Get the smell off the bowl.
Don't put cookies into it, then.
You can't feed the fish
the same thing all the time.
From the 1st to 4th
cervical vertebrae...
...one bullet went through
between the 3rd and 4th...
...and the other penetrated
between right and left atrium...
...which killed him instantly.
The heart was completely destroyed.
I've never seen anything
like this before.
The former coroner has.
Dr. Kim, Director Cho.
They're all the same.
She's at it again.
Goodbye....
Chodo Harbour, North Korea
For the Victory!
For the Victory!
No more corrupt politicians!
No more 50 years of separation,
disgrace, and humiliation!
We're writing a new
history of Korea!
And the beginning of it
is in your hands!
I expect to see you all again
under a unified sky.
Good luck.
For the unification.
For the unification.
Team 4, go!
Don't move!
He left nothing related
to his business.
No wonder.
They destroy everything that
could be used against them.
It's hard to find any connection
between Lim and Hee.
Then, we're back to square one.
People around Lim?
Lim took care of the business by himself.
Nobody knows anything.
Hee's been hiding out
for over a year.
I don't get it. A weapon's dealer
was her first target.
It's too easy for her.
Aren't we overreacting?
Could it be a gang war imitating her?
Nobody can imitate her.
We need to find out
what she wanted from him...
...and why he contacted us.
What did Hee ask him for?
What was the information
Lim tried to give us?
If she hasn't gotten
what she wanted from him yet...
...she'll try to get it through
other channels.
We need to focus on the fact that
North Korea's using her again...
...even though her identity
has been exposed to us.
You two are the best agents
we've got.
Finish her at your first priority.
What do you think was their
relationship?
Why'd she approach him?
I guess she needed something from him.
That's it. That thing she asked him
to get her. That's the key.
What'd he mean by something dangerous?
You look awfully serious.
We're late, come on.
I got delayed at the beauty parlor.
Have you waited long?
Not long.
How do I look?
We'd better hurry.
Did you sleep well?
Did I snore?
I was worried about that.
Were you tired?
He always sleeps at the theater.
I wish you had somebody
for times like these.
You two are here.
He isn't into anything.
He doesn't even like to sing
or listen to the music.
Really?
I grew up near the airport
cause my old man was a pilot.
So I can't tell a noise from a rhythm.
Nothing's music to my ears.
Then, what do you like?
I like looking for people.
Lately I've been looking
for my ex-girlfriend.
What's she like?
You want to take a look ?
She's cute.
Why did you break up?
So I can look for her.
Gosh, I'm sorry!
No problem.
Wipe it off with this.
Here...
I am really sorry.
It's punishment for dozing off
in the theater.
Excuse me.
When is your wedding day?
20th of next month.
When are you gonna tell her?
You can't hide it forever.
I don't wanna burden her.
What if you die on a mission?
What about her?
I can't, anyway.
Why not?
You don't trust her?
Don't be sentimental.
Let me ask you something.
If Hee and I point a gun
at each other...
...and you have to choose one.
Who would that be?
Hee, of course.
I'd save your ass
cause I can bust her later.
You don't get many chances.
You don't get many friends
you'd die for, either.
It's not too late, man.
You can change your mind.
Cheers.
I'm all wet!
Wait till that stain gets washed off.
I've had it.
Give me money for laundry.
Ask her.
I'll pay for it when I do that again.
Aim well next time.
I'll try.
Where are all the taxis?
Let's take a subway.
In this rain?
You're wet anyway.
I don't have a girl to take care of me
if I catch a cold.
Come on, let's run!
You sure?
It's gonna rain all night long.
I like it.
I don't think they do.
It's bedtime for them.
Looks like the rain woke them up.
What are they saying?
They want us to keep quiet.
How are your Kissingurami?
They fight a lot.
One minute, they hate each other...
...next minute they're hugging,
They're always like that.
When I go out,
I get worried about them.
If I am not there,
you have to take care of them.
I don't think I can.
I can't even handle 'Kissing'
and 'Anabus' at home
That's why you have to learn more.
To live with them,
you have no choice.
Your sweater is almost done.
I hope it looks good on you.
What should I get you
for the wedding?
All I want is...
...whatever happens to me,
you love and never leave me.
That's all.
Because you're the only one
who truly understands me.
shiri Step 1 On!
On the 17th, 1 million dollars
were transferred from Lim's account...
...into Kim's.
He looks most suspicious
on the transaction record.
Who's he?
Natl Defense lab researcher.
Kim speaking.
Yes.
As a part of new weapons system
being developed...
...we launched the CTX project
last year.
If Kim was doing business
with the weapon's dealer...
...chances are very high that
it was CTX.
Tell me more about the CTX.
CTX is a new type of energy...
...originally invented by
Korea Energy Development Lab...
...we've been working on turning
it into a weapon.
At first, we had problems with its
delicate detonation conditions...
...but the test we did last month
was successful.
People at your agency know
about this, too.
It'll bring a sensational change
to the military weapon system.
How's it different from the
conventional bombs?
It's a liquid bomb.
What's most amazing about CTX is
that it's indistinguishable from water.
When it's in a normal state,
there's neither smell nor color...
...and you can't detect the liquid
itself with any devices.
Yet the effect is ten
times more powerful than...
...any other bombs you've ever seen.
What if a black-market dealer got it?
He could get the information on it
but not the CTX itself.
Because you need 3 or 4
approvals to release it.
If Mr. Kim took a bribe
to hand it over...
...he would've returned the money.
Where's it made and kept?
That's confidential, sorry.
But CTX's never been released until today.
How are you so sure?
When CTX is released...
...it goes through 3
authorization checkpoints...
...and this morning
everything was in order.
You're saying it was released
this morning?
For the weapon show tomorrow,
it's being transferred to
headquarters as we speak.
Sera Mike 1,
stop at Dongsan service area.
Will Hee turn up?
She wants the CTX.
She wouldn't miss this chance.
Why are they bothering us?
They want two secret agents
to ride with us.
What for?
What the hell is that?
Sir,
We need to check the vehicles.
I wasn't informed of this.
What's going on?
We got a report of a possible
interception of CTX.
Your permit and ID, please.
CTX's safe with us.
Get out of the way.
Didn't you hear me?
I asked for your permit and ID,
This is Sera Mike 1,
we're stopped at a checkpoint.
I don't have time for this.
I'll fax it to you.
If you resist,
we'll have to arrest you.
What did you say?
We'll have to arrest you...
or kill you.
Are you nuts?
I'm fine.
Are you out of your mind?
You fucking moron!
Are you fucking nuts?
Wait, look at this.
What base are you from?
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea!
Sera Mike 1, Do you copy?
They've been hit!
It's worse than we thought!
It's a bomb, run!
Hee asked Lim for the CTX...
...and Lim bribed the researcher
to hand it over.
But when they realized
it couldn't be done...
... they planned to intercept it
on the road.
In the process, Lim and Kim
were murdered,
along with 20 of our armed guards.
How much CTX was taken?
About a gallon.
It is enough to blow up
an entire city.
Any leads on the interceptors?
Not yet, sir.
Just an assumption that they're
involved with Hee.
But why would North Korea
do that in a time of reconciliation?
We haven't seen the hidden
camera mounted on the vehicle...
...but the gunfire at the scene
makes me think...
...that they're highly-trained
North Korean militants.
Their military system is
falling fast.
We can't rule out the possibility that...
...they were a private organization
wanting the CTX for their own purpose.
The question is what are
they planning to do with the CTX.
If it blows up in Seoul,
we're finished.
Why not make an official statement to
the North-Korean government?
Not until we have solid proof.
We also need to figure out
why their target was the CTX.
As you all know,
it may explode without the detonator.
And no devices can detect the liquid itself.
If they utilize those traits,
expect the worst.
There's no way to predict when,
where, or how it's gonna go off.
Dinner?
I don't feel like it.
Is the meeting over?
Little while ago.
Anything special?
Ready to order?
Beer, please.
What about the scene?
An inspection of the scene
was delayed...
...and the bodies were just
taken to headquarters.
The film will be
handed over tomorrow.
Any leads?
Just bodies and shells.
Isn't it strange?
Anything else?
This is the third time.
Lim, Kim.. This time
CTX was intercepted.
We went to see Lim right
after the call...
.. and to the lab right after
we got the report.
We're always a step behind.
It's like they were reading our moves.
There's a leak.
It's impossible unless someone
inside leaked the information.
Don't jump to the conclusion.
Today we went to the lab
without notice.
Kim didn't even know that
we were coming...
...and he got killed 5 minutes
before we got there.
If that's the case...
it's obvious.
Only director Ko and I knew
about those killings and CTX.
And you made the report.
shiri 1's entered.
It's been a long time.
At 09:00.
With sunglasses on.
You've changed a lot.
It's been six years.
How's my family?
They're fine.
I miss them.
Completion is near.
You'll meet them soon.
A barrier is in the way.
Get rid of it.
Target?
Kissingurami.
Finish the job
before the completion.
Acknowledged.
For the unification.
For the unification.
We're always a step behind.
They were reading our moves.
There's a leak.
It's impossible unless someone
inside leaked the information.
Hello?
It's me, Ho.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Sure, what's going on?
I have a favor to ask.
Call me at the Police Agency
tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
I'll call you.
What are you doing there?
You scared me!
You just got here?
No, earlier.
I cleaned and did the laundry.
Nothing was in the refrigerator.
We ran out of coffee...
...so I went grocery shopping.
What's wrong?
You don't look so good.
Just busy at work.
Why didn't you call?
I was gonna leave soon.
Dinner?
Not yet.
I had a late lunch.
Let me fix dinner for us.
What are we having?
Your favorite.
You wanna take a shower?
After dinner.
I think it's done.
Let it simmer.
Can you hand me the cloth pins
and hangers from the sofa?
I couldn't find the pins.
Leave it, I'll do it.
When are you moving in?
Soon, I guess.
I haven't packed up yet.
Let me help you pack up.
With you here,
it won't be as lonely.
You hated eating alone
and waking up by yourself.
You'll whisper in my ear
to wake me up from now on.
I'll make the coffee,
and you'll play soft music.
Should we buy birds?
You'd like birds singing
in the morning.
Promise me...
...that you keep the promise
you made to me a year ago.
Trust me.
I'll never drink again
because I have you.
A soccer team of South and
North Korea returned today...
...to the Seoul Training Center
after training in Pohang...
...with North Korean officials
coming through 'Panmunjum'.
The North Korean President
Lee and officials...
...coming to the south for
the game and a conference...
...will deliver a message on
a permanent peace....
When it's in a normal state,
there's neither smell nor color...
...you can't tell the difference
from water with the naked eye.
But it's a different story
with the light on.
Turn it on.
It's on.
CTX responds to daylight
over 6000 kelvin.
The light alone may start
its reaction...
...but without heat, it's no good.
Fire.
Yes, sir.
It's on, sir.
If you expose it to both
light and heat...
...nitro-alpha inside the sphere
and beta outside react differently.
But when the liquid in the sphere
becomes red, the sphere pops.
Nitro-alpha and beta combined
causes the explosion.
How much power does it have?
This is about 200cc, so...
...everything within the radius
of 1 kilometer would disappear.
Since the detonation varies
depending on the reaction...
...the sensor here tells you
when it's exploding.
Like now,
if the sphere becomes red...
...it means the explosion is imminent.
If you don't stop it before
the sphere pops, it explodes.
But with either light or heat removed,
the reaction stops.
I've never seen an agent like you
in 20 years.
You're an oddball.
I am not, sir.
No, I am not.
Then I wouldn't be cleaning
the fish bowls.
Agent Ryu, come to room 17.
I gotta go.
Find CTX as soon as possible
so we can go drinking.
We'll find it!
Anyone recognizes him?
Don't you remember, Ryu?
His name is Park.
A top agent for the North Korean
8th special forces.
When Ryu stormed the plane
that'd been hijacked...
...he was the only one that
escaped from the plane...
...a painful memory for Ryu.
Clear!
Hee and Park...
All the pieces are coming together.
Agent Lee?
Find out what's going on
with 8th special forces.
And you get the daily data of
spy satellites from Natl Defense.
Agent Yoon!
Yes, sir.
Post Park's montage
throughout the country.
They're 8th special forces.
It's worse than we expected.
The 8th special forces intercepted
CTX, why?
Three possibilities here.
First, to sell it off to a third country.
Second, to use it
on the negotiation table...
... for money or to seek asylum
to another country.
Third, a strategy they are known for...
...they say they want peace
and stab us in the back.
It must be either for the money
or an explosion.
If they wanted the money, why CTX?
Robbing the Bank of Korea'd
be much easier.
Why'd they spoil the peace
conference by using the bomb?
That's difficult to answer.
Hee is key to all this.
We don't have time.
We'll find a way.
What do you see?
Can't even tell me?
Maybe the solution is
much closer than we think.
What do you mean?
Hee could be close by.
Hey, you!
What the hell are you doing here?
I am looking for the man's room.
Are you fucking blind?
Didn't see the sign ''RESTRICTED AREA''?
Hey, you hear me?
I sure did.
Watch your mouth.
Take care.
How have you been?
Bored to death.
I feel more insecure
when it's so quiet.
I need some backup.
What about your agency?
The air isn't very clear there.
What do you mean?
I think there's a leak.
This is the only way.
It must be very stressful.
It'll get better.
When do you need it?
Tomorrow.
I'm coming, too.
Sorry, no married man.
Time and place?
I'll call you.
All right, then.
Ho!
We'll talk later.
How's your friend?
He'll live.
I am glad to hear that.
Have a seat.
Who else knew
you two were meeting?
It was very personal.
I didn't tell anybody.
Lim, Kim, Ho....
Hee is very nearby.
There must be a leak.
Nobody knows that for sure.
Internal affairs are on it.
You don't trust your men?
Do you trust me?
Traps could be anywhere.
Maybe there's a hole in
the security system...
...but that possibility is almost zero.
Don't share the information
with anybody.
Not even with your partner, Lee.
Traps under your feet are
hard to see.
I'm the Director in charge.
I'm Park,
of the 8th special forces.
I want to talk to my old friend.
Thanks for calling me friend.
I was gonna send you a coffin,
but you were lucky.
Disappointed with Hee's shooting.
Save it.
We can take you out anytime.
Maybe I'll take you out first.
So, you've become a man.
You know where I am?
Young drunk kids here
yelling on the street....
While people in the north
are starving to death.
People here have wastes
building up in their bellies.
What an unfair world.
Listen, friend.
We have 10 CTXs placed
all over Seoul.
I'll call you 30 minutes before
each of them goes off.
You'd better find them before
people get hurt.
What do you want?
Slow down, friend.
The first one is on the roof
of the Golden Tower.
You have exactly 30 minutes.
You know the fish named shiri?
It's a Korean aboriginal fish,
living in crystal streams.
Though they're separated
with the country divided...
...some day they'll reunite
in the same streams.
Should I buy some for your
girlfriend's fish shop?
Why not.
Stay alive until then.
He's on the move.
Clear!
Found it!
Don't tell anybody you're here.
Page me if necessary,
and never use the phone here.
I checked you in under an alias.
Don't go out.
I'll take care of the shop.
What's going on?
Don't ask.
Please do as I say.
I don't wanna stay here.
You haven't touched a drop for a year.
This is me.
You know that, don't you?
You wanna know what?
Tell me what's wrong.
Dear People of the South...
...Today marks an important and joyous
moment in our history.
I am here to put an end to years of
confrontation and dissension...
...and to open up a new era
of understanding.
You got a call.
Hello?
A guy who knows everything
about the CTX contacted me.
He's Hee's informant,
and wants a deal.
Where are you?
I'm meeting him
at the Hwain Cultural Center
I'm on my way.
Be there.
On my way.
He's wearing a black jacket
and a black cap.
Anything else?
That's all.
I'll be right there.
You look good in a black jacket.
Anyone else coming?
Hee, maybe.
So you called me expecting someone
inside to leak the information?
I hope it worked.
Nobody at the agency knows
that I'm here.
You know it's impossible
to tape the phones.
So, if they show up...
...Im the rat?
The MSG-90 Hee uses is
a 5-shot semiautomatic.
She used only two bullets,
both for Lim and Ho.
In both cases,
you were in her range.
If I were her...
...I would have used
the other three bullets.
3 targets went inside.
Acknowledged.
Stay in position.
The mole must have been found.
For the unification!
Been a long time.
Good to see you.
Payback time for the flight 257.
Look who's talking.
You killed 7 of my men.
You left your men behind.
Cause I have a job to finish.
You wanna know what it is?
I'll ask Hee.
It's my turn to send you a coffin.
Won't be easy!
Get back!
She used only two bullets.
'In both cases,
you were in her range.'
lf I were her...
'...I would have used
the other three bullets.'
Name: Hyun
Residency: Cheju Island
Innate Immunodeficiency Syndrome
Admitted at Halla Hospital.
Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island.
Why'd you come here?
They ambushed us.
OP set a trap.
Because you didn't follow orders
to kill Ryu.
If this is for my failure,
I'll take the consequences.
Killing him. It was my personal order.
When I met you here,
I saw the confusion in you.
Thanks to you,
we lost two of our men!
I did what I could do.
Yeah, you saved my life.
What do you want?
You've changed.
Of course I have...
from Hee to Hyun.
Not only in appearance,
but inside as well!
I don't need a betrayer.
We've waited 10 years
for this moment.
In those hours of pain,
we pledged allegiance...
...and buried our youth in the
tomb of history.
If you want to turn your back
on us over personal feelings...
...finish it here.
I was stupid...
thinking I could be Hyun.
But I am just Hee
who has to kill her man.
I failed to change my inside.
Let go!
We have a job to finish.
Avoid any physical contact
with her, and no smoking...
...because her immune system
has dropped...
...and make it quick.
There she is.
with the yellow sweater.
Do you mind if I sit here?
Sure.
Are you from the public health center?
I am looking for this girl.
Anything happened to her?
She's my old friend.
I need to find her.
She rented a room in our house
2 years ago...
...and she'd visit me here quite often.
She was very nice to me
as if she were my real sister.
She said she'd call me from Japan
...I think she misplaced my number
otherwise she'd have called.
She went to Japan?
She said it was for plastic surgery
to remove a scar on her body.
The day she left
I cried my eyes out.
She hugged me, and went on about
how sorry she was.
I didn't even know
what she was sorry about...
She didn't do anyting to me
Prepare 10 million dollars
and a 7 47 Jumbo at the airport by 2 o'clock.
No mistakes.
The Golden Tower was
just the beginning.
I hope I don't have to use
the other 9 CTXs.
Hello? Hello!
Don't put cookies into the bowl.
Two of them died today.
I am not a fish shop boy.
I'm an OP agent, too.
You know how many fish bowls
we've got here?
I don't wanna deal with dead
bodies any more.
It's the cookies that killed it.
No autopsy is needed....
If this is for my failure,
I'll take the consequences.
Killing him. It was my personal order.
When I met you here,
I saw the confusion in you.
The soccer game between the
South and North will...
...finally be kicking off at Seoul
Main Stadium at 2 P.M today.
With the Presidents of
two nations present...
Hi, I'm here to collect
for the newspaper.
How much?
7 dollars.
It's all right.
Bye.
What are you doing here?
Going to a soccer game?
I had 4 goldfishes on my desk
with 4 goldfishes,
and 2 of them died today.
At first, I thought
it was the cookies that killed them.
But I was wrong
'SU300' inside their bodies is...
...a high-tech bug
that can be used underwater.
I suspected my partner these
last few days, including you.
I planted some bugs here...
...and got the information
that I didn't want to get.
From October 1996 to August 1997
When Hee disappeared,
you were in Japan.
You didn't need a fake passport
coming back in...
...because you became Hyun.
Ryu went to Cheju Island
to find the truth.
What makes me sad is that my buddy,
loved you with all his heart.
Let me ask you this.
Did you really love him?
Over here!
I planted a bug in your car...
Will you.... forgive me?
Stay with me!
The ambulance is on the way!
I.... messed up.
You're going to be Okay.
You've always been the best!
This won't.... kill me....
This won't....
Stay with me!
The 7 47's here.
Holding position, 100 meters northwest
from the terminal 2.
Snipers, make an entry through
section D and take position.
Their target is the soccer game.
They're on their way
to the stadium.
What are you talking about?
No time to explain.
The stadium is at stake!
They've set CTX around Seoul
and want 10 million dollars.
They were bluffing.
Why the stadium?
All the North Korean leaders
are gathered there.
Why would they do that?
How the hell do I know?
Call off the game immediately
and evacuate all the spectators.
Are you out of your mind?
Call off the game?
Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium!
Go back to Headquarters.
Don't worry about the stadium.
Not even a drop of water
can pass through security.
It won't work.
Listen to me!
You lost your partner today.
Go back, it's an order!
I understand about liquor,
but why not coffee?
It's the rule, sorry.
Your attention, please!
No beverages will be allowed
into the stadium.
Thank you for your cooperation.
The game will begin
in 30 minutes.
If I were in the airport,
no doubt I could prove myself.
But what the hell am I doing here,
watching the gate?
Both teams are
now entering the stadium.
What are you....
How have you been?
Attention, please.
Both Presidents Kim and Lee
have just arrived!
Let's give them a big hand!
Get the lights ready.
3-G, Royal Box
Section 3-G.
Turn them on. /
Turn the lights on?
Who's in charge of the lights?
What's wrong?
Did you turn on the lights
over the Royal Box?
Why would anybody do that
in a broad daylight?
They're on now!
Check it out.
Main substation, speaking.
Did you turn the lights on
in section 3-G?
Yes, there's a circuit problem.
I'm working on it.
Today is not a regular day, you know.
All right.
He'll turn them off soon.
Substation
Leave right away.
This is a restricted area.
Who's in charge?
You want to turn off the lights?
They'll never go out.
Hey, friend!
You finally made it here.
Where's your backup?
All at the airport?
Hello, Dr. Min?
It's me, Sik.
Can't you hear me?
It's me, the oddball!
I have a question about the CTX.
The CTX!
What did you say were the
conditions for self-detonation?
This will be the graveyard
for the corrupt politicians.
Not only the politicians,
but also innocent people.
This is crazy!
Sometimes history needs
a craziness to help it.
What do you want?
A war!
We're removing the barriers for a war.
These people are not your barriers.
When we're done here, our people's
revolutionary army will start a war.
It's not too late.
Turn the lights off now!
That's not what the
people of this land want.
They don't want another war
to kill each other!
Revolution always comes with pain.
Sacrifices are necessary.
There were people who thought
the same as you in 1950.
Remember the pain
that the war caused in this country.
I remember very well.
What pain the war
and separation left us.
I'm putting an end to it.
This game is to ease that pain!
I know it can.
We've waited for 50 years
under those politicians...
...but unfortunately,
they don't want reunification.
It's like we're watching
a well-written play.
Don't be mistaken.
You're not the only one
who wants reunification.
We have to wait for
the right moment.
''Our hope is reunification.
We dream about it...''
When you sing this song...
...our people in the North
are dying on the street.
They barely manage to live
with roots and barks.
Our sons and daughters are...
...being sold off
for fucking 100 dollars!
Have you ever seen parents eating
the flesh of their dead kids?
With cheese, coke, and hamburgers...
you wouldn't know.
A soccer game to unite the nations?
It's bullshit.
We've had enough with the
50 years of deception.
We're opening up
a new history of Korea.
4 minutes to go.
CTX will detonate soon.
History will judge us.
You know what?
The pain you suffered
for the last 50 years...
...came from one person's
misjudgment.
Stop!
Lights off in section 3-G?
Turn them off!
Right now!
Don't waste your time.
Nobody's turning them off.
Turn them off!
We're dying together here.
Pull the trigger.
Now!
Good thing I have company
on my way to hell
Turn the lights off?
You know where Hee is?
She's in the audience,
laughing at you.
You know where Hee is?
'She's in the audience,
laughing at you.'
Presidential guards, respond!
Evacuate the President!
Gate 52, he's on his way
to the parking lot.
Get out!
Natl Defense spokesman
revealed a war scenario attempted by..
..North Korea's 8th special forces.
They sent 5 secret agents
including Park into South Korea....
Things about oddballs!
One. Oddballs revolt like you guys.
Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning
like you don't.
I am not an oddball.
Three. Oddballs chicken out!
When'd you first meet her?
March, last year.
Give me the details.
The next day I went to see her.
I gave her a CD...
and we had dinner together.
We talked about music.
Didn't you ever feel
she was approaching you?
Then I wouldn't be here.
How were all the fish bowls
brought in here?
She wanted to put a few
in my office for decoration.
The agency bought the rest through me.
She was pregnant.
Did you know that?
She never told me.
How come?
She could have used it
to blindfold you.
According to our report,
you were getting married soon.
You didn't suspect her at all
dating for a whole year?
What do you want me to say?
Answer the question.
We don't trust anybody.
Even the fellow agents you share life with...
...but she was an exception.
It means you admit that
you neglected your duty?
It's not like you.
Agent Ryu is dead.
When was the first time
you met Hee?
It was Hyun, not Hee.
Let's call her Hee.
You know Hydra?
She's a Goddess with 6 heads
in Greek myths.
She has multiple personalities
with one body.
Hyun and Hee...
they're totally different.
Hydra of our times...
...the reality of separate Korea
turned her into Hydra.
This is Pager Voice Mail.
You have one new message.
...it's me, Hyun.
I am at the stadium.
CTX's planted in the lights
over the Royal Box.
They'll turn the lights on
from the substation.
I'll be sitting in the west wing
of the stadium.
Do me a favor.
I don't want to face you.
Send someone else to get me.
The times I had with you...
...is all of my life.
With you
I was neither
Hyun nor Hee...
... but just me.
I won't ask you to understand me.
I miss you so much.
I miss you....
How have you been?
It's you again.
Did you meet her?
No.
It would have been nicer
if you came with her.
They're Kissingurami.
For me?
They're beautiful.
Thanks a lot.
If one of them dies...
the other dies, too.
They dry up from loneliness, right?
Don't be surprised.
She knew everything about fish.
In fact...She stayed over here
quite a few times.
You know how bad she is
when she sleeps?
I found her under the bed
every morning.
And when eating,
you have to be alert.
This way, please.
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.
Make yourselves comfortable.
My master
will be with you shortly.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I don't sense anything.
It's not about the mission, Master.
It's something elsewhere, elusive.
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.
But not at the expense
of the moment.
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.
Yes, Master.
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?
These Federation types are cowards.
The negotiations will be short.
What? What did you say?
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.
I knew it.
They're here to force a settlement.
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.
Are you brain-dead?
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.
Send a droid.
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.
My lord, is that legal?
I will make it legal.
And the Jedi?
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.
Kill them immediately.
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.
Captain, look!
Shields-
Sorry.
Dioxis.
They must be dead by now.
Destroy what's left of them.
Oh! Excuse me.
Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
Roger, roger.
Uh-oh. Blast them.
What is going on down there?
We lost the transmission, sir.
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?
Well, no, but I don't-
Seal off the bridge.
Yes, sir.
That won't be enough, sir.
I want droidekas
up here at once!
We will not survive this.
Close the blast doors!
That will hold them.
They are still coming through.
This is impossible!
Where are those droidekas?
Master! Destroyers!
They have shield generators!
It's a standoff.
Let's go.
They're no match for droidekas.
Sir!
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.
Battle droids.
It's an invasion army.
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.
Let's split up.
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.
You were right
about one thing, Master.
The negotiations were short.
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.
It's Queen Amidala herself.
At last we are getting results.
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.
I was not aware of such failure.
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.
You must be mistaken.
Beware, Viceroy.
The Federation
has gone too far this time.
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.
You assume too much.
We will see.
She's right. The senate will never-
It's too late now.
Do you think she suspects an attack?
I don't know.
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?
How could that be true?
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.
It must- handiwork-
negotiate- ambassadors-
nobody would-
Senator Palpatine.
What's happening?
Check the transmission generator.
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.
The Federation
would not dare go that far.
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.
Our security volunteers
will be no match...
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.
Yes, Viceroy?
Captain, we've searched the ship...
and there is no trace of theJedi.
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.
Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.
Oh, no!
Get away! Get out of here!
Get down!
Hey, wait!
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?
I spake.
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.
Now, get out of here.
No, no, mesa stay.
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.
That won't be necessary.
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.
Oh, no!
Stay down!
You saved my again.
A local.
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.
More?
"More" did you spake?
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.
Can you take us there?
On second thought, no.
Not really, no.
No?
'Tis embarrassing...
but my afraid
my've been banished.
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.
You hear that?
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.
If they find us,
they will crush us...
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.
Yousa point is well seen.
Dis way. Hurry!
How much further?
Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?
Ah, my warning you.
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?
So good bein home!
Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.
Mesa back.
Noah gain,Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.
Yousa in big dudu dis time.
How wude.
Yousa cannot bees hair.
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.
Wesa no like da Naboo.
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.
Day tink day brains so big.
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.
Mesa no tink so.
Day not know of uss-en.
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.
Then speed us on our way.
Wesa ganna speed yous away.
We could use a transport.
Wesa give yousa una bongo.
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...
'tis goen through the planet core.
Now...
go.
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.
Master, what's a bongo?
A transport, I hope.
Deysa setten yousa up.
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.
Any help here would be hot.
Master, we're short on time.
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.
This Gungan may be of help.
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?
Hisen to be pune-ished.
I saved his life.
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt. "
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?
Begone wit him!
Count me outta dis one.
Better dead here
than dead in da core.
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!
Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
It's a longo tale-o...
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.
You were banished for being clumsy?
Yousa might'n be sayin dat.
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?
Yud-say boom da gasser...
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!
There's always a bigger fish.
Mesa tink we goen back now.
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.
Queen Amidala is young and naive.
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.
Yes, my lord.
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.
Where wesa goin?
Don't worry. The Force will guide us.
Oh, maxi big, da Force.
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.
We're losing power.
Oh, no!
Wesa dyin' here.
Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
What "yet"?
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?
Power's back.
Monster's back!
Relax.
You overdid it.
Head for that outcropping.
Oh, boy.
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.
Ah, victory.
Dis'n loverly.
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.
I will not cooperate.
Now, now, Your Highness.
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.
Commander.
Yes, sir.
Process them.
Captain, take them to Camp 4.
Roger, roger.
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.
Get their weapons.
Yousa guys bombad!
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.
The negotiations
never took place.
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.
They've knocked out
all our communications.
Do you have transports?
In the main hangar. This way.
There are too many of them.
That won't be a problem.
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.
They will kill you if you stay.
They wouldn't dare.
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.
They can't afford to kill her.
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.
We are brave, Your Highness.
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.
Be careful, Governor.
We'll need to free those pilots.
I'll deal with that.
Halt.
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.
Where are you taking them?
To Coruscant.
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.
Come on. Move!
Go!
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.
Hello, boyos.
There's the blockade.
The shield generator's been hit!
How wude!
We're losing droids fast.
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.
The shields are gone.
The power's back!
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.
Deflector shields up at maximum.
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.
Here, Master.
Tatooine.
It's small, out of the way, poor.
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.
How can you be sure?
It's controlled by the Hutts.
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.
If they discovered her-
It'd be no different than landing...
on a system controlled
by the Federation...
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...
which gives us the advantage.
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?
She has disappeared, my lord.
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.
I want that treaty signed.
My lord...
it's impossible to locate the ship.
It's out of our range.
Not for a Sith.
This is my apprentice...
Darth Maul.
He will find your lost ship.
This is getting out of hand.
Now there are two of them.
We should not
have made this bargain.
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.
It is to be commended.
What is its number?
R2-D2, Your Highness.
Thank you, R2-D2.
Clean this droid up
as best you can.
It deserves our gratitude.
Continue, Captain.
Your Highness,
with your permission...
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.
Hello.
Sorry. Husa are yousa?
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.
You're a Gungan, aren't you?
How'd you end up here with us?
My no know.
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow-
mesa here.
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.
That's it- Tatooine.
There's a settlement.
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.
I sense a disturbance in the Force.
I feel it also, Master.
Don't let them send
any transmissions.
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.
The queen wishes it.
She's curious about the planet.
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.
Moisture farms,
for the most part.
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.
The few spaceports like this one...
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.
Like us.
Dissen berry, berry bad.
Icky, icky goo!
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.
My droid has a readout of what I need.
So, let me take thee out back, huh?
We'll find what you need.
Don't touch anything.
Are you an angel?
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.
They live on the moons of lego,
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.
You're a pilot?
Mm-hmm. All my life.
How long have you been here?
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.
You're a slave?
I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
I'm sorry.
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.
I got ya.
Hey!
Hit the nose.
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.
Saying of which...
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
Republic credits?
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.
No, they won't.
Credits will do fine.
No, they won't!
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.
No money, no parts, no deal.
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.
We're leaving. Jar Jar.
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.
I was glad to meet you too.
Yippee!
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?
A few containers of supplies.
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...
not in the amount
you're talking about.
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.
I'll check back later.
Noah gain. Noah gain.
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.
Are you going to pay for that?
It costs seven wupiupi.
Oops.
Who, mesa-
Hi there.
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.
He picked a fight with a Dug...
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.
Thanks, my young friend.
But mesa doen nutten!
This storm will slow them down.
Looks pretty bad.
Receiving a message from home.
We'll be right there.
Here, you'll like these pallies.
Here.
Thank you.
My bones are aching.
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.
Do you have shelter?
We'll head back to our ship.
Is it far?
It's on the outskirts.
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.
Mom!
Mom, I'm home!
Ah, dissen cosy.
These are my friends, Mom.
Hello.
I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.
He's wonderful.
You really like him?
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.
Where is everybody?
Whoops.
Oh, hello.
human cyborg relations.
How might I serve you?
He's perfect.
Oh. Perfect.
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.
A pleasure to meet you.
human cyborg relations.
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?
My parts are showing?
My goodness!
The death toll is catastrophic.
We must bow to their wishes.
You must contact me.
It's a trick.
Send no reply.
Send no transmissions of any kind.
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?
Either way,
we're running out of time.
Tatooine is sparsely populated.
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.
Move against the Jedi first.
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...
to sign the treaty.
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.
At last we will have revenge.
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.
They will be no match for you.
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.
Any attempt to escape-
And they blow you up!
How wude!
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.
The Republic's antislavery laws-
The Republic doesn't exist out here.
We must survive on our own.
Xcuse me.
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?
They have Podracing
on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.
I'm the only human who can do it.
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.
Don't do that again.
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?
What makes you think that?
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.
I don't think so.
No one can kill a Jedi.
I wish that were so.
I had a dream I was a Jedi.
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.
Have you come to free us?
No, I'm afraid not.
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...
on a very important mission.
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.
I can help.
I believe you can.
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.
Podracing.
Greed can be a powerful ally.
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.
You could enter my pod.
Anakin, Watto won't let you.
Watto doesn't know I've built it.
You could make him think
it was yours...
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.
But, Mom, I love it.
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.
Your mother's right.
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?
No.
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.
We'll find some other way.
There is no other way.
I may not like it,
but he can help you.
He was meant to help you.
Are you sure about this?
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?
The queen will not approve.
The queen doesn't need to know.
Well, I don't approve.
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.
How can you do this?
Not on the Republic credits,
My ship will be the entry fee.
Not bad!
Not bad, huh?
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.
What would the boy ride?
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.
It wasn't my fault.
Really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.
I actually saved the pod, mostly.
That you did.
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.
The fastest ever built.
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...
and I supply the boy.
We split the winnings 50-50,
If it's going to be 50-50...
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.
If we win...
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.
Either way, you win.
Deal!
What if this plan fails, Master?
We could be stuck here
a very long time.
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.
there's something about this boy.
You should be very proud of your son.
He gives without any thought
of reward.
He knows nothing of greed.
He has-
He has special powers.
Yes.
He can see things
before they happen.
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.
It's a Jedi trait.
He deserves better
than a slave's life.
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.
Who was his father?
There was no father.
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.
I can't explain what happened.
Can you help him?
I don't know.
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.
Wow, a real astro droid!
How do you get so lucky?
That isn't the half of it.
I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
You're such a joker, Ani.
You've been working on that for years.
It's never gonna run.
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.
Keep away from
those energy binders.
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.
My tongue is fat.
My tongue- Wrench.
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.
It will.
I think it's time we found out.
Here, use this power charge.
Yes, sir!
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.
My mouth.
My tongue is fat.
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.
Thank you.
Go.
It's working!
It's working!
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?
Most of them.
Has anyone been to 'em all?
Not likely.
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.
Ani, bedtime!
There we are.
Good as new.
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.
What are you doing?
Checking your blood for infections.
Go on.
You have a big day tomorrow.
Sleep well, Ani.
Yes, Master?
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.
Wait a minute.
I need a midi-chlorian count.
The reading is off the chart.
Over 20,000.
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.
No Jedi has.
What does that mean?
I'm not sure.
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.
Patience, my blue friend.
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.
And we'll be far away from here.
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I warn you, no funny business.
You don't think Anakin can win?
Don't get me wrongo.
I have great faith in the boy.
He's a credit to your race...
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.
Oh, no!
Why do you think that?
He always wins!
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.
I'll take that bet.
I'll wager my new racing pod
the boy and his mother.
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.
The boy, then.
We'll let fate decide, huh?
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.
Blue, it's the boy.
Red...
his mother.
You won this small toss,
outlander...
but you won't win the race!
So it makes little difference!
What'd he mean by that?
I'll tell you later.
Good morning.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.
Do what?
Finish the race, of course.
You've never won a race?
Well, not exactly.
Not even finished?
Kitster's right.
I will this time.
Of course you will.
That's absolutely right.
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.
Two-time winner Boles Roor.
Sebulba!
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...
Mawhonic!
A hearty hello...
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.
And hoping for a big win today...
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...
a local boy.
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.
Be safe.
I will, Mom. I promise.
You all set, Ani?
Yep.
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.
I will.
May the Force be with you.
Jabba the Hutt.
Welcome.
Begin the race!
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.
Is he nervous?
He's fine.
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not-
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.
You should too.
You assume too much.
Start your engines.
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!
Oh, no!
Little Skywalker has stalled.
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.
Come on, Ani!
And there goes Skywalker!
Go, Ani, go!
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...
on the canyon dune turn.
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.
Oh, no!
Where is Master Anakin?
Look. Here he comes.
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.
Yay! Yippee!
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!
Here he comes!
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...
followed closely by Skywalker!
Go, Ani!
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!
It's Skywalker!
Sebulba!
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!
Did he crash-ed?
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!
He's catching Sebulba!
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!
That little human being
is out of his mind!
They're side by side!
Yippee!
I can't believe it.
The crowds are going nuts!
Mom, I did it! Yay!
Good going, Ani!
We owe you everything, Ani.
It's so wonderful, Ani.
You have brought hope
to those who have none.
I'm so very proud of you.
You!
You swindled me.
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.
I lost everything.
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?
I'm sure they can settle this.
Take him.
Hidoe!
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.
I'm going back.
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.
Come on. Hup!
Hey. These are yours.
Yes!
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.
And he has been freed.
You're no longer a slave.
Did you hear that?
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.
You are free.
Will you take him with you?
Is he to become a Jedi?
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.
Nothing happens by accident.
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.
Can I go, Mom?
this path has been placed
before you.
The choice is yours alone.
I wanna do it.
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.
What about Mom?
Is she free too?
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.
It is time for you to let go.
I don't want things to change.
But you can't stop the change...
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.
I love you.
Now hurry.
Thank you.
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.
Will you be all right?
Yeah.
Hello, Master Anakin.
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...
and I'm going away in a starship.
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...
give you coverings and all.
I'm gonna miss working on you.
You've been a great pal.
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.
Sell me?
Bye.
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.
Will I ever see you again?
What does your heart tell you?
I hope so.
Yes.
I guess.
Then we will
see each other again.
I will come back
and free you, Mom.
I promise.
Now, be brave...
and don't look back.
Don't look back.
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!
I'm tired!
Anakin! Drop!
Go!
Tell them to take off!
Qui-Gon's in trouble.
Take off.
Over there. Fly low.
Are you all right?
I think so.
What was it?
I'm not sure...
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.
My guess is
it was after the queen.
What are we gonna do about it?
We shall be patient.
Anakin Skywalker...
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...
and you, Governor,
are going to die...
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.
This invasion
will gain you nothing.
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.
Take him away.
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...
for these rumoured
underwater villages.
They will not
stay hidden for long.
The death toll is catastrophic.
We must bow to their wishes.
You must contact me.
You all right?
It's very cold.
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.
A little too warm
for my taste.
Space is cold.
You seem sad.
The queen is worried.
Her people are suffering, dying.
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...
I'm not sure what'll happen.
I made this for you...
so you'd remember me.
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.
It'll bring you good fortune.
It's beautiful.
But I don't need this
to remember you by.
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...
but my caring for you will remain.
I care for you, too, only I-
Miss your mother.
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
Welcome, Your Highness.
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.
There is a question
of procedure...
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.
The situation has become
much more complicated.
Ani, come on.
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.
Pitty hot.
There is no civility,
only politics.
The Republic
is not what it once was.
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.
There is no interest
in the common good.
I must be frank, Your Majesty.
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.
If I may say so, Your Majesty...
the chancellor
has little real power.
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.
The bureaucrats are in charge now.
What options have we?
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...
one who could control
the bureaucrats...
and give us justice.
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
He has been
our strongest supporter.
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.
Our people are dying, Senator.
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.
To be realistic, Your Majesty...
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...
for the time being.
That is something I cannot do.
He was trained in the Jedi arts.
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.
Impossible.
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.
Hard to see,
the dark side is.
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.
May the Force be with you.
Master Qui-Gon.
More to say have you?
With your permission, my master...
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.
A vergence, you say.
Located around a person?
A boy.
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...
I have seen in a life-form.
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.
You believe it's this boy?
I don't presume to-
But you do.
Revealed your opinion is.
I request the boy be tested,
Master.
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?
was the will of the Force.
I have no doubt of that.
Bring him before us, then.
The boy's here to see Padmé.
Let him in.
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.
Who is it?
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.
I've sent Padmé on an errand.
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...
to start my training, I hope.
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.
Thank you, Your Highness.
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...
a tragedy has occurred...
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.
This is outrageous!
I object
to the senator's statements.
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...
who speaks on our behalf.
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade-
I object!
There is no proof!
This is incredible.
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.
The Congress of Malastare...
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.
A commission must be appointed.
The point-
Excuse me, Chancellor.
Enter the bureaucrat.
The true rulers of the Republic.
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.
The point is conceded.
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...
to explore the validity
of your accusations?
I will not defer.
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.
If this body
is not capable of action...
I suggest new leadership is needed.
I move for a vote
of no confidence...
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
Vote now! Vote now!
Order!
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...
a strong chancellor...
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.
They will not go along
with you this time.
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.
A speeder.
How feel you?
Cold, sir.
Afraid are you?
No, sir.
See through you we can.
Be mindful of your feelings.
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.
I miss her.
Afraid to lose her,
What has that got to do
with anything?
Everything.
Fear is the path to the dark side.
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.
Hate leads to suffering.
I sense much fear in you.
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?
I don't know.
Gungans get pasted too, eh?
I hope not.
Gungans no die'n without a fight.
Wesa warriors.
Wesa got a grand army.
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.
Your Highness?
Your Highness...
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...
as supreme chancellor.
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.
Who else has been nominated?
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.
I will be chancellor.
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.
Senator, this is your arena.
I feel I must return to mine.
I've decided to go back to Naboo.
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.
I will sign no treaty, Senator.
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.
Your Highness.
Ready my ship.
Please, Your Majesty.
Stay here where it's safe.
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.
The Force is strong with him.
He is to be trained, then?
No, he will not be trained.
No?
He is too old.
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.
Clouded this boy's future is.
I will train him, then.
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.
Impossible to take on a second.
The code forbids it.
Obi-Wan is ready.
I am ready to face the trials.
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...
but he is capable.
There is little more
he can learn from me.
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.
Now is not the time for this.
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.
And draw out the queen's attacker.
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.
This is the clue we need...
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.
May the Force be with you.
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.
From your point of view.
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.
The council will decide
Anakin's future.
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.
You won't be, Ani.
I'm not allowed to train you...
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.
Always remember:
Your focus determines your reality.
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.
Master, sir...
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.
I've been wondering-
What are midi-chlorians?
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...
that resides
within all living cells.
They live inside me?
Inside your cells, yes.
And we are symbionts with them.
Symbionts?
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.
They continually speak to us...
telling us the will of the Force.
When you learn
to quiet your mind...
you'll hear them speaking to you.
I don't understand.
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.
I welcome your help.
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.
Wesa goin' home!
Come on, R2.
Is the planet secure?
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.
We are in complete control
of the planet now.
Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...
things stay as they are.
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.
Yes, my lord.
A Sith here?
Those are the forward stabilizers.
And those two control the pitch?
You catch on pretty quick.
As soon as we land...
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.
I agree.
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.
I will take back what's ours.
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.
We have no army.
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war for you.
Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa, Your Highness?
Yes. I need your help.
I have one battleship on my scope.
It's a droid control ship.
They've probably spotted us.
We haven't much time.
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.
Good.
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.
And we cannot use our power
to help her.
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.
You've been a good apprentice,
And you're a much wiser man
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.
Desa nobody dare!
The Gungan city is deserted!
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?
More likely they were wiped out.
Mesa no tink so.
Do you know where they are,Jar Jar?
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.
Jar Jar Binks.
Who's da uss-en uthers?
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.
I come before you in peace.
Ah, Naboo biggen.
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.
Yousa all bombad.
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.
Your Honour.
Whosa dis?
I am Queen Amidala.
This is my decoy...
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.
I ask you to help us.
No, I beg you to help us.
We are your humble servants.
Our fate is in your hands.
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?
Mesa lika dis!
Maybe...
wesa...
being friends.
We've sent our patrols.
We already located
their starship in the swamp.
It won't be long, my lord.
an unexpected move for her.
It's too aggressive.
Lord Maul, be mindful.
Let them make the first move.
Yes, my master.
Deysa comin!
All right!
They're here!
Good. They made it.
Yousa doen grand.
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.
Oh, no, no, no.
So, wesa make you...
bombad general.
General?
Your Highness.
What is the situation?
Almost everyone's in camps.
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...
and much stronger.
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.
The battle is a diversion.
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.
Once we get
to the main entrance...
will create a diversion.
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.
What do you think, Master Jedi?
The viceroy will be well-guarded.
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.
Wesa ready to do our-san part.
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.
We will send
what pilots we have...
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.
There's an even bigger danger.
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...
he will return
with another droid army.
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.
Everything depends on it.
She is more foolish
than I thought.
We are sending all troops...
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.
It appears to be made up
of primitives.
This will work to our advantage.
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?
Wipe them out.
All of them.
Halt!
Starting up the shield.
Open fire.
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.
Sure.
Stay there.
Roger, roger.
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.
This is too close.
Ani, find cover.
Get to your ships!
Fighters straight ahead.
Roger, Bravo Leader.
Roger, Bravo Leader.
Cease fire.
Steady. Steady.
Activate the droids.
Yes, sir.
Ouch time.
Fire!
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.
Red group! Blue group!
Everybody, this way!
Hey, wait for me!
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.
Stay in that cockpit.
We'll handle this.
We'll take the long way.
We gotta do something, R2.
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.
Nope. Wait. Here it is.
Yeah!
Let's go!
It's on automatic pilot.
Try to override it.
We don't have time for this,
Look, there they are.
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.
Dumb droid. Take that!
Get off! Get off! Get off!
Get off!
The deflector shield
is too strong.
This is tense!
R2, get us off this autopilot.
It's gonna get us both killed.
You did it, R2!
Let's go left.
Go back?
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.
Go!
Ascension guns!
Retreat! Retreat!
Dis is nutsen.
Uh-oh. Big boomers.
Give me a lift!
Jar Jar, usen da booma!
Mesa no have a booma!
Here. Taken dis one.
Jar Jar!
Jump,Jar Jar, jump!
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.
We're hit, R2!
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!
Everything's overheated.
Oops. This is not good.
No giben up, General Jar Jar.
Mesa think of something.
My give up. My give up.
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...
this pointless debate in the senate.
Viceroy!
Your occupation here has ended.
After her.
This one's a decoy.
Jam the doors.
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.
Take this!
Oops.
We're losing power.
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.
Impossible!
Nothing can get through our shield.
Let's get outta here.
It's blowing up from the inside!
We didn't hit it.
Now, this is Podracing.
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!
What the-
Was'n they doing?
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!
They all broke-ed.
No, it's too late.
No.
Promise-
Promise me
you will train the boy.
Yes, Master.
He is the chosen one.
He will bring balance.
Train him.
Now, Viceroy...
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
And you, young Skywalker.
We will watch your career
with great interest.
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.
It's you who should be
congratulated.
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...
I do not.
Qui-Gon believed in him.
The chosen one the boy may be.
Nevertheless...
grave danger I fear
in his training.
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.
I will train Anakin.
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.
Need that you do not.
Agree with you the council does.
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.
What will happen to me now?
The council have granted me
permission to train you.
You will be a Jedi, I promise.
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.
Always two there are.
No more, no less.
A master and an apprentice.
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.
This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.
Arrest her.
On what charges?
No!
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.
Is he present?
What are the charges?
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.
I don't believe that was the answer
to the question I asked.
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.
The charge is "conspiring to set free
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire
and condemned to death,
for which the..."
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Yes, I thought you might.
on a dead man's chest
had done for the rest
Prisoners, come on!
Sorry, mate.
Mind if we make a little side trip?
I don't think so.
Not quite according to plan.
Complications arose, ensued,
were overcome.
You got what you went in for, then?
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,
were expecting something
a bit more... shiny,
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.
And the hurricane.
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.
Aye, shiny.
Is that how you're all feeling?
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?
What did the bird say?
Do not blame the bird.
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.
You know that don't do no good.
It's a key.
No. Much more better.
It is a drawing of a key.
Gentlemen,
What do keys do?
Keys...
Unlock things?
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.
No.
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?
So we're going after this key.
You're not making any sense at all.
Any more questions?
So... do we have a heading?
Ha! A heading.
Set sail in a...
general...
that-way direction.
Come on, snap to and make sail. You
know how this works. Go on. Oi, oi, oi!
Have you noticed lately,
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.
the prisoner as ordered, sir.
Those won't be necessary.
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.
We wish for you to act as our agent
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?
And we've each
left our mark on the other.
What mark did he leave on you?
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.
I would like you to go to him
and recover a certain property
in his possession.
Recover. At the point of a sword?
Bargain.
Letters of marque.
You will offer what
amounts to a full pardon.
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.
Freedom.
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.
The world is shrinking,
the blank edges of the map filled in.
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.
You and your fiancée
face the hangman's noose.
So you get Jack and the Black Pearl.
The Black Pearl?
The property you want that he possesses.
A ship? Hardly.
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.
A compass?
Ah, you know it.
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.
Why is the rum always gone?
That's why.
As you were, gents.
Bootstrap.
Bill Turner.
You look good, Jack.
Is this a dream?
No.
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.
You got the Pearl back, I see.
I had some help retrieving
the Pearl,by the way.
Your son.
William?
He ended up a pirate after all.
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?
He sent me.
Davy Jones.
So it's you, then.
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?
I chose it.
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.
I stood up for you.
Everything went wrong after that.
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.
Unable to move.
Unable to die, Jack.
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.
I would trade anything for it.
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.
You made a deal with him too, Jack.
He raised the Pearl
from the depths for you.
13 years, you've been her captain.
Technically...
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.
Yes, with the Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...
Then it's the locker for you!
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?
I already told you, Jack.
Your time is up.
It comes now,
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!
On deck! Scurry!
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!
Do we have a heading?
Argh! Run! Land.
Which port?
I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.
Jack's hat! Bring her about!
Leave it!
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!
For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?
Nothing.
Here, now, you can't be here.
I think you'll find he can.
Governor Swann, still.
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow
does not mean
he would do the same for anyone else.
Now, where is that dog with the keys?
I have faith in you.
Both of you.
Where will you find him?
Tortuga. I'll start there
and I won't stop searching till I find him.
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.
Properly?
Eagerly, if you'll still have me.
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.
I'll wait for you.
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
Captain Jack Sparrow?
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.
Jack Sparrow?
I haven't seen him in a month.
When you find him,
will you give him a message?
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,
but there's an island
just south of the straits
where I trade spice for...
mm, delicious long pork.
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.
A ship with black sails.
My brother will take you ashore.
What's wrong? The beach is there.
C'est trop dangereux.
C'est trop dangereux, je vous l'avais dit.
Bon voyage, monsieur.
Jack Sparrow!
Marty!
Cotton!
Anybody?
Ah! A familiar face.
Don't eat me.
I'm not going to eat you.
Don't eat me.
Come on! Let's go!
Come on! Who wants it?
I can do this all day!
Jack Sparrow!
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.
Jack, it's me.
Will Turner.
Tell them to let me down!
...eensy-weensy.
...eunuchy. Snip, snip.
That's all I need.
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for helping you.
She faces the gallows!
Save me.
Jack, what did you tell them?
No!
What about Elizabeth?
Come a little closer.
We don't bite.
Go on. We won't bite you.
Come quickly.
Tell me what's happening.
Our name still has some standing.
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.
No! Will's gone to find Jack!
We cannot count on William Turner.
Come!
He's better than you give him credit for.
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only -
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.
Even if Will succeeds,
do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.
A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
Then there is nothing left for you here.
Whoa!
Wait inside.
Evening, Governor.
Shame, that.
He was carrying this.
It's a letter to the king.
It's from you.
No...
Elizabeth.
What are you doing?
Where is she?
Who?
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,
as your father believes.
Then what is?
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.
I'm here to negotiate.
I'm listening.
I'm listening intently.
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.
Or else I would not still be here.
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.
It will do you no good.
Do explain.
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.
There is something
you need to know.
Ah, I see.
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.
But you mustn't worry.
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.
My desires are not so provincial.
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.
So I did.
A marriage interrupted...
or fate intervenes?
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.
These aren't going to Jack.
Oh, really?
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then,
I'll still want that compass.
Consider that in your calculations.
I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.
And I say it was me being clever.
Ain't that right, poochie?
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine
Providence what inspired you to be clever?
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.
You know you can't read.
It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...
Look.
There it is.
What's got into him?
Must have seen a catfish.
Stupid mongrel!
Argh!
Come on!
It's ours for the taking.
Tide's coming in. That should help.
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.
There's the truth of it!
Suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.
Amen to that.
Thank you.
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,
and they intend to do him the honor
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.
They'll roast him and eat him.
Where's the rest of the crew?
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.
The feast is about to begin.
Jack's life will end
when the drums stop.
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?
No, no. Oi! No, no.
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.
I am Chief. Want big fire.
Come on.
Tout de suite.
Come on. More wood.
Whoa!
Oh, bugger.
A little seasoning, eh?
Well done.
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.
About six would do.
Oh, dear.
Hurry!
Come on!
Come on! Is that all you got?
Wait. Stop.
Stop. Shh.
Stop.
Snake!
Move!
Well, go on, go get them.
No, no. Oi! No, no!
Not good.
Cut it loose! Find a rock!
Roll the cage!
Come on!
Lift the cage! Hurry!
Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.
This way, lads!
Take cover!
Stop it!
Bugger.
Haul loose the mooring line!
The mooring line!
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!
Don't bite it!
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.
How'd you get it back last time?
Excellent! Our work's half done.
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.
Make ready to sail, boys!
What about Jack?
I won't leave without him.
Time to go.
Cast off those lines!
Aaargh!
Make ready to cast off!
Good doggy.
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day you almost...
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Let's get away from this island
and head out to open sea.
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.
I need that compass of yours, Jack.
I must trade it for her freedom.
Mr. Gibbs.
We have a need to travel upriver.
By need, do you mean a trifling need?
Fleeting?
No, a resolute and unyielding need.
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
William,
I shall trade you the compass
if you will help me
to find this.
You want me to find this?
No.
You want you to find this,
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding
and/or locating in your discovering a way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.
This is going to save Elizabeth?
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?
Not much.
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.
What's all this?
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.
Is it, now? And you?
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.
All the men, they can feel it.
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.
A virgin too, likely as not.
And that bodes ill by all accounts.
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.
Enough! Enough!
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.
A young woman, by the look of it.
I want you to search the ship
and find her.
Oh, and, er... she's probably naked.
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
Well, if you believe such things,
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones,
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.
The Kraken.
They say the stench of its breath is like...
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odor of a thousand rotting corpses.
If you believe such things.
And the key will spare him that?
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.
Bad enough even to go visit...
her.
Her?
Aye.
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.
Were. Have been.
Before.
I'll watch your back.
It's me front I'm worried about.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Jack Sparrow.
Tia Dalma.
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.
You...
You have a touch of...
destiny about you,
William Turner.
You know me?
You want to know me.
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.
I thought I knew you.
Not so well as I had hoped.
Come.
Come.
What service may I do you?
You know I demand payment.
Look.
An undead monkey.
Top that.
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.
The payment is fair.
We're looking for this.
And what it goes to.
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?
Maybe. Why?
I hear you.
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.
Or do you know,
but are loath to claim it as your own?
Your key go to a chest.
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?
What is inside?
Gold?
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?
Nothing bad, I hope?
You know of Davy Jones,
yes?
A man of the sea.
A great sailor,
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.
What vexes all men?
What indeed?
The sea.
The dichotomy of good and evil.
A woman.
A woman.
He fell in love.
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.
See, it was a woman
as changing and harsh
and untamable as the sea.
Him never stopped loving her.
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with
but not enough to cause him to die.
What exactly did he put
into the chest?
Him heart.
Literally or figuratively?
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.
Could he?
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.
And so...
him carve out him heart,
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.
The key
he keep with him at all times.
You knew this.
I did not. I didn't know where the key was.
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?
Let me see your hand.
The black spot!
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?
My little beauty, where are you?
Such a long time in such a mess.
Davy Jones cannot make port.
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,
and so you will carry land with you.
Dirt.
This is a jar of dirt.
Yes.
Is the jar of dirt going to help?
If you don't want it, give it back.
No.
Then it helps.
It seems we have a need to find
the Flying Dutchman.
A touch of destiny.
That's the Flying Dutchman?
She doesn't look like much.
Neither do you.
Do not underestimate her.
Must have run afoul of the reef.
So, what's your plan, then?
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.
And if there are crewmen?
I cut down anyone in my path.
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.
It might save your life.
Douse the lamps.
Sailor.
Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
Sailor!
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.
There's no use.
You've run aground.
No.
Beneath us.
Foul breath.
Hey! Hey!
Down on your marrowbones and pray.
Get back! Get back!
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.
Do you fear death?
Do you fear that dark abyss?
All your deeds laid bare.
All your sins punished.
I can offer you
an escape.
Do you not fear death?
I'll take my chances, sir.
To the depths.
Cruel blackguard!
Life is cruel.
Why should the afterlife
be any different?
I offer you a choice.
Join my crew
and postpone the judgment.
One hundred years before the mast.
Will ye serve?
I-I will serve.
There.
You are neither dead nor dying.
What is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.
What is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.
Did he, now?
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
You have a debt to pay.
You've been captain of the Black Pearl
for 13 years.
That was our agreement.
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years
as Captain Jack Sparrow?
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.
One soul is not equal to another.
We've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.
Price?
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?
One hundred souls.
Three days.
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.
That leaves you only 99 more to go.
Have you not met Will Turner?
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.
Worth at least four.
Maybe three and a half.
And did I happen to mention...
he's in love?
With a girl.
Due to be married.
Betrothed.
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony.
I keep the boy. 99 souls.
But I wonder, Sparrow,
can you live with this?
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?
Yep. I'm good with it.
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.
Three days.
Three days.
Er, Mr. Gibbs.
Aye.
I-I feel sullied and unusual.
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.
Tortuga.
Tortuga.
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.
An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.
S-sir!
to do something.
She's trying to give a sign.
Whoa!
Over there! Look for a sign!
Look, there! There it is!
There's the sign!
That's seaweed.
Seaweed can be a sign.
Looks like entrails.
That would be a bad sign.
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
I've never sailed a day in me life.
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!
My wife ran off with my dog
and I'm drunk for a month
and I don't give an ass rat's
if I live or die.
Perfect. Next!
I know what I want. I know what I want...
Me have one arm and a bum leg.
It's the crow's nest for you.
I know what I want.
Ever since I was a little lad, I've always
wanted to sail the seas... forever.
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.
Thanks very much.
Including those four, that gives us... four.
And what's your story?
My story.
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.
I chased a man
across the seven seas.
The pursuit cost me my crew,
my commission,
and my life.
Commodore?
No, not any more. Weren't you listening?
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.
Lord.
You didn't try to sail through it?
So, do I make your crew
or not?
You haven't said where you're going.
Somewhere nice?!
So, am I worthy to serve
under Captain Jack Sparrow?
Or should I just kill you now?
You're hired.
Sorry. Old habits and all that.
Easy, sailor!
That's our captain you're threatening.
Time to go.
Aye!
Thanks, mate.
Aargh!
Carry on.
Come on, then! Who wants some?
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.
Come on, who's first?
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.
James Norrington.
What has the world done to you?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner!
Set to it!
Step aside.
Hey! Mind yourself!
Let go, boy!
No.
Haul that weevil to his feet.
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!
No!
Impeding me in my duties?
You'll share the punishment.
I'll take it all.
Will you, now?
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?
My son.
He's my son.
What fortuitous circumstance be this?
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.
No. No, I won't!
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.
No.
Bosun!
No!
You had it easy, boy!
Will.
I don't need your help.
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh
from bone, with every swing.
So I'm to understand
what you did was an act of compassion?
Yes.
100 years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.
Once you've sworn an oath
to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.
Not until your debt is paid.
I've sworn no oath.
You must get away.
Not until I find this.
The key.
The dead man's chest.
What do you know of this?
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...
No, don't stab the heart.
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.
So the captain has the key?
Where is the key?
Hidden.
Where is the chest?
Hidden.
Captain Sparrow!
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.
I'm here to find the man I love.
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.
Elizabeth.
Hide the rum.
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.
I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but...
through unfortunate circumstances
that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.
Davy Jones?
Oh, please.
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?
You look awful. What are you doing here?
You hired me.
I can't help it if your standards are lax.
You smell funny.
All I want is to find Will.
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?
Of course.
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.
And you'd have a way of doing that?
Well...
...there is a chest.
Oh, dear.
A chest of unknown size and origin.
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.
And whoever possesses that chest
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.
You don't actually believe him, do you?
How would we find it?
My compass... is unique.
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken".
True enough,
this compass does not point north.
Where does it point?
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.
Are you telling the truth?
Every word, love.
And what you want most in this world
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?
To save Will.
By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
Mr. Gibbs!
We have our heading.
Finally!
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!
Miss Swann.
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.
There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it.
I assure you, these are not necessary.
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.
You have news of her?
Most recently seen on Tortuga,
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,
and other fugitives from justice.
"Justice"? Hardly.
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.
I find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board.
What do you want from me?
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.
To you, you mean.
Shall I remove these shackles?
Do what you can for my daughter.
So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.
Even for what he hoped never to sell.
I wager... ten years.
I'll match ten years.
Agreed.
Wondering how it's played?
I understand.
Liar!
It's a game of deception. But your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.
What are they wagering?
Oh, the only thing we have.
Years of service.
So any crew member can be challenged?
Aye. Anyone.
I challenge Davy Jones.
I accept, mate.
The stakes?
My soul. An eternity of servitude.
No!
I want this.
How do you know of the key?
That's not part of the game, is it?
You can still walk away.
I'm in. Matching his wager.
No! Don't do this.
The die is cast.
I bid three twos.
It's your bid, Captain.
Four fours.
Four fives.
Six threes.
Seven fives.
Eight fives.
Welcome to the crew, lad.
Twelve fives.
Twelve fives.
Call me a liar, or up the bid.
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore...
the very next time we make port!
Fool. Why did you do that?
I couldn't let you lose.
It was never about winning or losing.
The key.
You just wanted to know where it was.
Captain says I'm to relieve you.
Captain's orders.
Here. Take this, too.
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.
It was always in my blood to die at sea.
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.
You owe me nothing, Will.
Now go.
They'll know you helped me.
What more can they do to me?
I take this with a promise.
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.
I will not abandon you.
I promise.
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.
Bleurgh!
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.
Of course.
He wants the chest.
Yes, he did say something about a chest.
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.
A truly discomfiting notion, love.
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.
Brace the foreyard!
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?
Persuasion.
Friendly?
Decidedly not.
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one
with the prize - full pardon.
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England
and the East India Trading Company."
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.
Jack, the letters, give them back.
No.
Persuade me.
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?
As I said, persuade me.
It's a curious thing.
There was a time I would have wanted you
to look like that while thinking about me.
I don't know what you mean.
I think you do.
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancé
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?
a longboat so far out in open water.
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.
And what are we running from?
That dress. Where did you get it?
It was found aboard the ship.
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.
That's foolish.
Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",
and we made a nice bit of profit there.
Off the books, of course.
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.
Why do you ask?
Captain! A ship's been spotted.
Colors?
She isn't flying any.
Pirates.
Or worse.
You will watch this.
Let no joyful voice be heard!
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.
Aargh!
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake...
the kraken.
No!
I've doomed us all.
It's the Flying Dutchman!
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?
Must have hit a reef.
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.
Free the rudder!
Hard to port!
Kraken!
Kraken!
Here it is! Take it!
Take it!
Aargh!
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.
I am the sea.
You need time alone with your thoughts.
Brig!
What of the survivors?
There are no survivors.
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.
Get me there first,
or there'll be the devil to pay.
"First"?
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?
Who told him of the key?
Jack Sparrow.
My intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.
I just thought I'd be married by now.
I'm so ready to be married.
You know...
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,
and being captain of a ship, I could in fact
perform a "marr-i-age" right here.
Right on this deck.
Right... now.
No, thank you.
Why not?
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.
Oh. Except for a sense of honor
and decency and a moral center.
And personal hygiene.
Trifles.
You will come over to my side. I know it.
You seem very certain.
One word, love. Curiosity.
You long for freedom.
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.
To act on selfish impulse.
You want to see what it's like.
One day, you won't be able to resist.
Why doesn't your compass work?
My compass works fine.
Because you and I are alike,
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.
To do the right thing.
I love those moments.
I like to wave at them as they pass by.
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.
And when you do,
you'll discover something.
That you're a good man.
All evidence to the contrary.
Oh, I have faith in you.
Want to know why?
Do tell, dearie.
Curiosity.
You're going to want it.
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.
You won't be able to resist.
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.
I do want to know what it tastes like.
But... seeing as you're a good man,
I know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honor.
I'm proud of you, Jack.
I want my jar of dirt.
You're pulling too fast.
You're pulling too slow.
We don't want the kraken to catch us.
I'm saving me strength for when it comes.
And I don't think it's "Kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "Krayken".
With a long "a"?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken"
is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,
and "Kracken" is closer to that.
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
Krayken.
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.
Don't touch my dirt.
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.
You're sitting on it.
Beg pardon?
Move.
Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!
I could join the circus.
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.
You'll trust us to act in your stead?
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!
Down, then!
Down!
It's real.
You actually were telling the truth.
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.
With good reason!
Will!
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.
Not so easy, is it?
But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
You do?
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...
...I was reunited with my father.
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!
Pretty much.
Time and tide, love.
Oi! What are you doing?
I'm going to kill Jones.
Can't let you do that, William.
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call
his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?
Now, if you please.
The key.
I keep the promises I make, Jack.
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.
I deliver it, I get my life back.
Ah. The dark side of ambition.
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.
Guard the chest!
No!
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...
Oh, fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.
That will solve everything! I've had it!
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!
How'd this go all screwy?
Well, each wants the chest for hisself.
Mr. Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honor,
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business
'twixt him and his
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.
Terrible temptation.
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.
Enough!
The heat!
Bugger!
By your leave, Mr. Turner.
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.
Do excuse me
while I kill the man who ruined my life.
Be my guest.
Let us examine that claim for a moment.
Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?
So whose fault is it, really,
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?
Enough!
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!
Still rooting for you, mate.
Oh! Oof!
Aargh!
Hello, poppet.
Come on, run!
Sword! Sword!
Sword!
Aargh!
Follow my voice.
Follow my voice.
To the left... no, turn around.
Go to the right.
No, that's a tree.
Jar of dirt!
Argh!
Come on, Turner!
Leave him lie! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.
We're not getting out of this.
Not with the chest.
Into the boat.
You're mad!
Don't wait for me.
I say we respect his final wish.
Aye!
Your bravery is wasted.
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.
Here you go!
Oof!
Pirates!
Hey!
What happened to the chest?
Norrington took it to draw them off.
You're pulling too hard!
You ain't pulling hard enough!
Where's the commodore?
Fell behind.
My prayers be with him.
Best not wallow in our grief.
The bright side is you're back,
and made it off free and clear.
Lord on high, deliver us.
I'll handle this, mate.
Oi, fishface!
Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!
Got it!
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?
Look what I got.
I got a jar of dirt
Enough!
Hard to starboard.
Hard to starboard!
Brace up the foreyard!
Hard to starboard!
Send his beloved Pearl
back to the depths.
She's on us! She's on us!
Let them taste the triple guns.
Aye, Captain.
Aaargh!
Make fast!
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!
Come on, girl!
She's falling behind!
Aye. We've got her!
We're the faster?
Against the wind, the Dutchman beats us.
But with the wind...
We rob her advantage.
Aye.
We're out of range!
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!
We're giving up, sir?
They're giving up!
My father is on that ship.
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?
We must have hit a reef!
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!
The kraken.
To arms!
Load guns! Defend the mast!
It'll attack the starboard. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!
Easy, boys!
Will?
Steady! Steady.
Will!
Hold. Hold.
I think we've held fire long enough.
Will!
Fire!
It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
There's no boats.
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!
Whatever you do, don't miss.
As soon as you're clear.
We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!
Hurry up!
There's only six kegs of powder!
Then load the rum.
Aye, the rum too!
Step to!
Oh, you coward.
Not good.
Haul away!
Heave!
Heave like you're being paid for it!
Put your backs into it!
Aargh!
I got you! I got you!
Don't let me go!
I won't let you go!
Shoot me!
Clear?
Higher! Higher!
Here! Come on!
Come and get me. I'm over here!
Come on!
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!
Did we kill it?
No. We just made it angry.
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.
Jack. The Pearl.
She's only a ship, mate.
He's right.
We have to head for land.
It's a lot of open water.
It's a lot of water.
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship or abandon hope.
Thank you, Jack.
We're not free yet, love.
You came back.
I always knew you were a good man.
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.
Come on, Will. Step to!
It's after you, not the ship.
It's not us.
This is the only way, don't you see?
I'm not sorry.
Pirate.
Where's Jack?
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.
Go!
Bugger. Bugger, bugger,
bugger, bugger, bugger!
Come on!
Just got it. Come on.
Not so bad.
Hello, beastie.
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.
The captain goes down with his ship.
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.
Open the chest.
Open the chest. I need to see it!
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!
Is there any news on the chest?
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.
He had these.
I took the liberty of filling in my name.
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.
Do you have the compass?
Better.
The heart of Davy Jones.
Against the cold...
and the sorrow.
It's a shame.
I know you're thinking that with the Pearl
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.
Doesn't matter now.
The Pearl is gone,
along with its captain.
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.
He fooled us all right till the end,
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.
To Jack Sparrow.
Never another like Captain Jack.
He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.
He was a good man.
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...
Elizabeth.
Would you do it?
What would you...
What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious Pearl?
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Yes.
Aye.
All right.
