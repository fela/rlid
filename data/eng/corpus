Oh, Master Ani!
I knew you would return.
I knew it!
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.
Hello, 3PO.
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.
I've come to see my mother.
Oh. Um, I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.
Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors.
I'm Anakin Skywalker.
Owen Lars. Uh, this is my girlfriend, Beru.
Hello.
I'm Padmé.
I guess I'm your stepbrother.
I had a feeling you might show up someday.
Is my mother here?
No, she's not.
Cliegg Lars.
Shmi is my wife.
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.
Your mother had gone out early, like she always did to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators.
From the tracks, she was about halfway home when they took her.
Those Tuskens walk like men but they're vicious, mindless monsters.
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.
I'd be out there with them, but after I lost my leg I just couldn't ride anymore un-until I heal.
I don't want to give up on her but she's been gone a month.
There's little hope she's lasted this long.
Where are you going?
To find my mother.
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.
You're gonna have to stay here.
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.
Anakin... I won't be long.
We must persuade the Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty.
What about the senator from Naboo?
Is she dead yet?
I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk.
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.
With these new battle droids we've built for you you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.
As I explained to you earlier I am quite convinced that 10,000 more systems will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen.
What you are proposing could be construed as treason.
The Techno Union army is at your disposal, Count.
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.
Good. Very good.
Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support and when their battle droids are combined with yours we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy.
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.
The Republic will agree to any demands we make.
Mom.
Mom? Mom?
Ani?
Ani? Is it you?
I'm here, Mom.
You're safe.
Ani?
Ani?
Oh, you look so handsome.
My son.
Oh, my grown-up son.
I'm so proud of you, Ani.
I missed you.
Now I am complete.
I love y... Stay with me, Mom.
Everything... I love... I... I love... Anakin!Anakin! No-o-o!
What is it?
Pain, suffering death I feel.
Something terrible has happened.
Young Skywalker is in pain.
Terrible pain.
The transmitter is working, but we're not receiving a return signal.
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?
We'll have to try something else.
Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo. It's much closer.
Anakin?
Anakin, do you copy?
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Anakin?
He's not on Naboo, R4.
I'm going to try and widen the range.
I do hope nothing's happened to him.
That's Anakin's tracking signal, all right but it's coming from Tatooine.
What in the blazes is he doing there?
I told him to stay on Naboo.
We haven't got much time.
Anakin?
Anakin, do you copy?
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Retransmit this message... Anakin, do you copy?
Anakin... My long-range... has been knocked out.
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.
I brought you something.
Are you hungry?
The shifter broke.
Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things.
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.
But I couldn't... Why'd she have to die?
Why couldn't I save her?
I know I could have!
Sometimes there are things no one can fix.
You're not all-powerful, Ani.
Well, I should be!
Someday I will be.
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever!
I promise you.
I will even learn to stop people from dying.
Anakin.
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!
He's holding me back!
He's jealous!
He's holding me back!
What's wrong, Ani?
I killed them.
I killed them all.
They're dead.
Every single one of them.
And not just the men but the women and the children too.
They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals!
I hate them!
To be angry is to be human.
I'm a Jedi.
I know I'm better than this.
I know wherever you are it's become a better place.
You were the most loving partner a man could ever have.
Good-bye, my darling wife.
And thank you.
I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom.
I wasn't strong enough.
But I promise I won't fail again.
I miss you so much.
R2? What are you doing here?
It seems that he is carrying a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Hmm. Master Ani, does that name mean anything to you?
Anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out.
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.
I have tracked the bounty hunter, Jango Fett to the droid foundries on Geonosis.
The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala.
The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming a... Wait. Wait.
More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed.
I agree.
Anakin, we will deal with Count Dooku.
The most important thing for you is to stay where you are.
Protect the senator at all costs.
That is your first priority.
Understood, Master.
They'll never get there in time to save him.
They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look.
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
If he's still alive.
Ani, are you just gonna sit here and let him die?
He's your friend, your mentor. He's... He's like my father!
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here!
He gave you strict orders to protect me and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.
If you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along.
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that.
Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
The debate is over.
Now we need that clone army.
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.
The senate will never approve the use of clones before the separatists attack.
This is a crisis.
The senate must vote the chancellor emergency powers.
He can then approve the creation of an army.
But what senator would have the courage to propose such a radical amendment?
If only Senator Amidala were here.
Mm.
Traitor.
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.
They have gone too far.
This is madness.
I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.
This had nothing to do with me, I assure you.
I will petition immediately to have you set free.
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long. I have work to do.
May I ask why a Jedi knight is all the way out here on Geonosis?
I've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett.
Do you know him?
There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of.
The Geonosians don't trust them.
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.
It's a great pity that our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.
Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you.
I wish he were still alive.
I could use his help right now.
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.
You forget that he was once my apprentice just as you were once his.
He knew all about the corruption in the senate but he would never have gone along with it if he had learned the truth as I have.
The truth?
The truth.
What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control of the dark lord of the Sith?
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.
The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend.
Hundreds of senators are now under the influence of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.
I don't believe you.
The viceroy of the Trade Federation was once in league with this Darth Sidious but he was betrayed ten years ago by the dark lord.
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.
You must join me, Obi-Wan and together we will destroy the Sith!
I will never join you, Dooku.
It may be difficult to secure your release.
It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact wesa desa Federation du Trade.
Senators, "dellowfelagates": In response to this direct threat to the Republic mesa propose that the senate give immediately emergency powers to the supreme chancellor.
Palpatine! Palpatine! Palpatine!
Order! We shall have order!
It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling.
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.
The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated.
And as my first act with this new authority I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.
It is done, then.
Hmm.
I will take what Jedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino, hmm and see this army they have created for the Republic.
See those columns of steam straight ahead?
They're exhaust vents of some type.
That'll do.
Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead.
I'm not interested in getting into a war here.
As a member of the senate maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess.
Don't worry. I've given up trying to argue with you.
My obtuse little friend, if they had needed our help they would have asked for it, hmm?
You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behavior.
For a mechanic you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking.
I am programmed to understand humans!
"What does that mean?" Oh!
That means I am in charge here!
Where are you going now?
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?
Oh! Idiot!
Please wait.
Do you know where you're going?
Wait.
Oh, my... Oh, oh, oh!
Padmé!
Ah!
Oh, my goodness!
Shut me down!
Machines making machines.
Huh! How perverse.
Oh!
Calm down, R2.
I almost fell.
You'll get your chance... Oh! I'm scrap.
It's a nightmare!
Oh, I want to go home! Ahh!
Oh, what did I do to deserve this?
Ahhh!
Hmm. I wonder what happened to poor little R2.
He's always getting himself into trouble. Oops.
Oh, no!
Uh-oh.
Oh!
Oh, I'm so confused.
Oh, not again.
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.
Don't move,Jedi!
Take him away.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid to die.
I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
What are you talking about?
I love you.
You love me?
I thought that we had decided not to fall in love that we would be forced to live a lie and that it would destroy our lives.
I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway.
I truly deeply love you and before we die, I want you to know.
Eeyah!
I was beginning to wonder if you'd got my message.
I retransmitted it just as you had requested, Master.
Then we decided to come and rescue you.
Good job.
Settle down. Settle down.
Let the executions begin.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Just relax. Concentrate.
What about Padmé?
She seems to be on top of things.
She can't do that!
Shoot her or... or something!
Whoa! Yah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Jump!
Hyah! Hyah!
This isn't how it's supposed to be!
Jango! Finish her off!.
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.
Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us.
This party's over.
Brave but, uh, foolish, my old Jedi friend.
You're impossibly outnumbered.
I don't think so.
We'll see.
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.
What's all this noise?
A-A battle!
Oh, there's been some terrible mistake!
I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!
Die,Jedi dogs!
Oh! What did I say?
Hah!
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
Ohh!
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.
You call this a diplomatic solution?
No, I call it aggressive negotiations.
Uh-oh.
Roger, roger.
R2, what are you doing here?
What are you doing?
Oh, stop that!
You're going to strain something. My neck!
Now where are you taking me?
Oh, this is such a drag.
Oh, I'm quite beside myself.
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!
Yes, but is my head on straight?
Master Windu, you have fought gallantly worthy of recognition in the archives of the Jedi order.
Now it is finished.
Surrender, and your lives will be spared.
We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku!
Then, I'm sorry, old friend.
Look!
Look!
Around the survivors a perimeter create.
Oh, I've had the most peculiar dream.
If Dooku escapes rally more systems to his cause he will.
Hold on!
Aim right above the fuel cells!
Good call, my young Padawan.
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.
That doesn't seem possible.
How could the Jedi come up with an army so quickly?
We must send all available droids into battle.
There are too many.
Our communications have been jammed.
Pilot, land in that assembly area!
Yes, sir.
Sir, I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir.
To the forward command center take me.
Attack those Federation starships!
Quickly!
Master Yoda, all forward positions are advancing.
Very good.
Very good.
This is not looking good at all!
We must get the starships back into space.
We have to order a retreat.
My master will never allow the Republic to get away with this treachery.
I'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs.
The Jedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon.
If they find out what we are planning to build, we're doomed.
I will take the designs with me to Coruscant.
They will be much safer there with my master.
Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship.
Yes, sir.
Move all quadrants to sector 5-1 -5.
Look over there!
It's Dooku!
Shoot him down!
We're out of rockets, sir.
Follow him!
We're gonna need some help!
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!
Padmé!
Put the ship down!
Anakin!
Don't let your personal feelings get in the way! Follow that speeder!
Lower the ship!
I can't take Dooku alone!
I need you! If we catch him, we can end this war right now!
We have a job to do!
I don't care! Put the ship down!
You will be expelled from the Jedi order!
I can't leave her!
Come to your senses!
What do you think Padmé would do were she in your position?
She would do her duty.
Hmm.
The droid army is in full retreat.
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.
We'll take him together.
Go in slowly on the left.
I'm taking him now!
No, Anakin! No! No!
As you see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours.
Now... back down.
I don't think so.
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.
Surely you can do better.
Are you all right?
Uh-huh.
We'd better get back to the forward command center.
No. No.
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.
Get a transport. Hurry!
Right away.
Ah! Ahh!
Brave of you, boy.
But I would have thought you had learned your lesson.
I am a slow learner.
Anakin!
Master Yoda.
Count Dooku.
You have interfered with our affairs for the last time.
Powerful you have become, Dooku.
The dark side I sense in you.
I've become more powerful than any Jedi.
Even you.
Much to learn you still have.
It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force but by our skills with a lightsaber.
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.
This is just the beginning.
Anakin!
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.
You have done well.
I have good news for you, my lord.
The war has begun.
Excellent.
Everything is going as planned.
Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the senate?
It doesn't feel right.
Joined the dark side Dooku has.
Mmm. Lies, deceit creating mistrust are his ways now.
Nevertheless, I feel we should keep a closer eye on the senate.
I agree.
Where is your apprentice?
On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala home.
I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
Victory?
Then why don't you stop him, Avi?
What the fuck do you know?
Shoot that toad now.
One more step, Avi.
Just like a squeeze of toothpaste.
You realise what you're doing, Mr Green?
Hold on, Jake. This isn't the plan.
This won't have a happy ending.
One more step, Avi.
Wake up, Mr Green.
Congratulations, Mr Green.
It's past the third day and you have risen.
I think you're due for a check-up.
Did the bad guys get you?
There's no such thing as "bad guys", Rachel.
Yes, there are.
That's why Daddy's friends are looking after us.
Never mind about that. Why don't you bea good girl and get your Uncle Jake a cold drink?
It's a bit of a mess, isn't it?
Things will sort themselves out.
Is she all right?
Don't you worry about her.
You just look after yourself.
Mr Green, I don't know how to tell you this.
Our first results, they must have been wrong.
I cannot apologise enough for this error.
You're not a well man, but We have to assess our clients very carefully.
There is something about yourself that you don't know.
Something that you will deny even exists until it's too late to do anything about it.
It's the only reason you get up in the morning, the only reason you suffer the shitty boss, the blood, the sweat and the tears.
This is because you want people to know how good, attractive, generous, funny, wild and clever you really are.
"Fear or revere me, but please think I'm special." We share an addiction.
We're approval junkies.
We're all in it for the slap on the back and the gold watch.
The "hip, hip, hoo-fucking-rah." Look at the clever boy with the badge, polishing his trophy.
Shine on, you crazy diamond.
Cos we're just monkeys wrapped in suits, begging for the approval of others.
If we knew this, we wouldn't do this.
Someone is hiding it from us.
And if you had a second chance, you would ask Why?
Why what?
Why am I still alive?
Why did you give my money away?
Why didn't you want 'em to know?
Why didn't you want me to know?
You'll find out soon enough.
Whilst I've been digging around on Lord John I came across a couple of cash-talking shit-sniffers who came up with the name Green.
That's right, Jake Green.
Go on.
I'm working for his brother.
Patrick.
A couple of opportunists, looking after his older brother, got a little bit greedy.
Want to impress you.
All right, you take Sorter and Slim Biggins and enough men to avoid an excuse.
It's about fucking time.
Now that is a picture.
You took your sweet-ass time.
I was starting to get bored.
You should have kept busy with a swim.
Funny you should say that.
Zach's quite a swimmer, aren't you, Zach?
20 lengths in ten seconds.
We thought it might be a record. You want to try to beat it? Come on in and join us.
I'll just pop upstairs, grab my trunks, and be down in a jiffy.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, and why is that, Avi?
Why do you think we're in this icy birdbath, when we could be upstairs, toasty and cosy, watching the naughty channel?
How long can it take to get five coffees and a couple of pizzas?
You are on your own, Jakey boy.
Move.
You've got to tell the boss.
Why me?
Because you're the one who ordered the pizza.
This time you're going to tell me what's going on.
Two sugars, am I right?
Forget the tea, Avi.
Thank you, Jenny, that will be all.
You didn't tell us the truth about the three Eddies did you, Mr Green?
The Eddies upset Macha in some way so he had them used as aggregate, and mixed into some concrete on one of his buildings.
Would you like us to remind you of what really happened?
The Eddies were waiting for you when you got out of prison.
It was Macha's fault.
They didn't work for him any more, and wanted to compensate you.
What they really meant was they wanted to put 12 grams of angry lead in the back of your fucking head.
But you gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.
No-one kills a man who's going to make 'em money.
So you would give them 3% a month on any money they would lend you.
You needed the money quickly for some small but profitable deal that you'd made on the inside.
In fact, it was more profitable than any rate they can get anywhere, legal or illegal.
So, one of them said I'm in.
A month later he got his money back.
Plus your 3%.
Now, nobody kills a man who's going to make him money.
They always protect their investment.
I can give you 4% a month.
You know this is just between us?
That's right, Eddie.
Next deal - this time they're all in.
I give you 4% a month.
For two years you always came through, regular like clockwork.
But there was no deal.
You would take money off of one Eddie and repay the other Eddie, plus the 4%.
Plus your 4%. On top.
You were not greedy, you did it nice and slow.
You were paying for their trust.
This is just between us, right, Jake?
That's right, Eddie.
It was the easiest money they'd known. Soon they couldn't give you their money fast enough.
A few months later they didn't have enough of their own to lend, so they started to borrow money off Macha.
Plus your 3%.
Plus your 4%.
Macha became interested.
How could the Eddies have such a good little earner?
They hid you like a dirty little secret.
Find out who's behind this.
Who's behind this?
Ask no questions, hear no lies.
They tell anything but the truth.
Find out if Green is behind this.
Is Jake Green behind this?
I'll tell you, no, it's not Jake Green.
They'd do anything to protect their investment.
I'm not sharing the golden goose.
But Macha got his interest, so he kept loaning them more and more.
Lend them the money.
You were back gambling, making more money than you knew what to do with. You were rich.
I am rich.
Seriously fucking rich.
After a year, you had enough of the Eddies' money, or should I say Macha's money Now I'm richer. A lot fucking richer. to buy a chain of hotels.
So you went on a discreet three-month holiday.
You took your brother, his daughter, Macha's money and you enjoyed yourself.
A bit of the old sun, sand, sea and sausages.
The Eddies meanwhile were having a terminal argument about how they were going to pay back Macha that obscene amount of cash they owed him.
I want my money back, Paul.
Those boys really suffered, Jake. The more they told the truth, the more they suffered.
It's Jake Green.
He's telling the fucking truth.
They told me that story already.
Give me the truth.
You gave them just enough rope to hang themselves.
You're a good little conman, Jake.
And you think you're smart, and you are, just not as smart as you think you are.
Elvis. Come here.
If I wanted vinegar, I would have ordered French fries.
Get me something with a price tag on it. Mr Green. What did he do, anyway?
Hamish?
It's OK, we're among friends.
Come on, what have you got for me?
What am I going to tell him?
That's your problem, but it had better be good.
I turned up to pick them up and that is what I saw.
That's a fascinating story.
I have one question for you.
How?
How what?
How what?
There were six of us, plus Slim Biggins, who counts as another six.
How many were there of him?
One.
One.
So, how exactly did this "one" manage to disarm and overpower a four-time national body-building champion, drag him half a block, throw him over a six-foot wall and then get him to eat his own gun?
Get down, boss.
Just find the gunman.
Don't fucking move.
Lou. Lou.
Keep the boss down.
What the fuck's going on?
I don't know.
Sorter just shot the and he went in the kitchen.
Nobody fucking move.
Bastard.
Keep the fucking boss down.
She shot my finger off.
The bitch shot my finger off.
Who is it?
Happy Tony, Lord John's man.
Not looking so happy now, is he?
Check she's dead, Lou.
Greed gets them all in the end.
Now, shoot straight, Sorter.
Glad to see you've got those feelings in check.
Find a couple of Lord John's boys and persuade them to tell you where my powder is.
What is the first rule of any game, Mr Green?
The only way to get smarter is by playing a smarter opponent.
What's rule two of any game?
The more sophisticated the game, the more sophisticated the opponent.
Almost the same, but where does it stop, Mr Green?
Where does this game stop?
It stops when you start to give me answers.
Don't let them play head games with you, Jake.
Is it me that's playing head games with you, Mr Green?
You've heard their voice for so long, you believe it to be you.
You believe it to be your best friend.
They should believe their opponent to be their best friend.
Where's the best place an opponent should hide?
In the very last place you would ever look.
Do you know who Sam Gold is, Mr Green?
You should, because he knows who you are.
The Gold, Sam Gold.
Mr Clandestine.
Mr Ambiguous.
Mr Mystery.
He's all up here, pretending to be you.
No-one sees Gold, but Gold sees everything.
You're in a game, Jake.
You're in the game.
Everyone's in his game, and nobody knows it.
And all of this, this is his world.
He owns it.
He controls it.
I've had enough of this shit.
Tell him you've had enough.
He tells you what to do Look, that's enough. and when to do it.
Tell him.
I said that's enough, Avi.
Eventually, when the opponent is challenged or questioned, it means the victim's investment and thus his intelligence is questioned.
No-one can accept that, not even to themselves.
He's behind all the pain there ever was.
Behind every crime ever committed.
How can I be behind all the pain, all the crime, if I don't even exist?
And right now, he's telling you that he doesn't even exist.
No-one lives and displeases Gold.
No-one but your two friends.
We just put you to war with the only enemy that ever existed, and you, you think he's your best friend.
And they will protect their best friend with everything they've got.
You're protecting him, Mr Green, but with what?
Where's the best place an opponent should hide?
In the very last place you'd ever look.
He's hiding behind your pain, Jake.
You're protecting him with your pain.
Embrace the pain and you will win this game.
And I know nothing hurts more than humiliation and a little money loss.
If you change the rules on what controls you you will change the rules on what you can control.
How radical are you prepared to be, Mr Green?
The more power you think you have in Gold's world, the less power you have in the real world.
You are still in prison, Jake.
In fact, you never left.
Remember who they are, Jake.
Head tricksters, word slicksters.
You wanted answers and they gave you riddles.
You know the rules, the longer you listened, the sweeter the pitch.
He's got all the tricks and all the right answers.
Don't let them do this to you, Jake.
Don't let them turn you against you.
You don't give because it's good.
You give because it hurts him.
What are we doing here?
He's the enemy, Jake, not me.
Use your perceived enemy to destroy your real enemy.
Do not listen, Jake.
You've got a gun. Use it.
Don't wake him up. Suffocate him.
Put the pillow over his head and suffocate him.
He'd do it to you, Jake.
If you can't do it, then you're not a free man.
You are controlled.
Controlled? Free man?
Jake, wake up.
Look, Mr Macha, I'm very sorry to have woken you. Please listen to me.
Who's that? Mr Green?
Mr Macha, please, I'm sorry to have woken you.
Listen to me.
"Sorry." Listen at how you sound.
I came to apologise.
Forgive me for the things I've said and for cheating you out of your money.
I couldn't think clearly.
Shut up.
No, no, that's too much.
Shoot the fucker. Shoot him.
He's been trying to kill you.
He killed your friend, shot like a fucking dog.
That's better, Jake, in control again.
Do the right thing.
Take care of your enemy, take care of business.
Use any means possible to induce head pain, and engage the enemy.
Shut up.
Wake up, Jake.
What are you fucking doing?
Leave it.
You're grovelling.
I now realise you're a man to be feared and respected.
I now realise you're a man to be feared and respected.
Stop grovelling.
Where's your pride?
Where's your pride?
I made a big mistake, Mr Macha.
Shut up.
I underestimated your power and your intellect.
I've made a donation in your name as a peace offering, as a token of my apology.
I want you to Shut up.
I want you to forgive my stupidity.
Wherever you don't want to go is where you will find him.
What is it that you are afraid of, Mr Green?
Why are you doing this to yourself, Jake?
It's too tight, Jake.
We've got to get out.
You're going to die in a tiny space, Jake.
Have to get out.
We're stuck, stuck.
The walls are moving in.
It's tight. I'm scared.
We've got to get out. I can hear you.
I can hear you.
What?
I can hear you.
I'm onto you.
Who takes care of the good times?
We're a team.
We're best pals, Jake.
You want to get rid of me?
Do you know life without me?
No. Because it doesn't exist.
Do they talk about me, Jake?
No.
Because I don't exist.
Tell all your friends about me then, Jake?
I protect you and I control you.
I say do, you obey.
If I say you're scared you're scared.
You've been listening to the other side, haven't you, Jake?
Listening to people who want to hurt you.
New people. New.
Not old friends like me.
People you shouldn't trust. Not me. I've been your friend forever, since the beginning.
Get rid of them, Jake, forever.
They're the enemy, not me.
They're new, I'm old. I stay, they go.
I say you do.
You do.
You're weak without me, weak.
It's us against them, Jake.
It's us against them.
I'm coming to get you.
You want to get rid of me?
You want to make an enemy out of me?
You want to get rid of me, do you?
Do you?
You want to get rid of me, me, me, me?
Still here, Jake?
How long have I looked after you?
You can't win this one without me.
You know why?
I am you.
You ain't me.
The greatest con that he ever pulled, was making you believe that he is you.
You ain't me.
I am you.
You're not me.
Come on.
Your best fucking friend.
I am you.
You don't control me.
I control you.
You come to my house with a loaded gun.
You speak to me like I'm a fucking idiot.
What's your game?
What's your game?
Speak to me.
Speak to me.
Or I'll kill you like the fucking dog that you are.
Fear me.
Fear me.
We have already killed Lord John and two of your colleagues.
If you value your life more than a few bags of white powder, you will tell me where it is hidden.
Is everything all right, Mr D?
It will be when you take care of my security, Paul.
What are you holding the papers for?
Because you're on the cover of half of them.
If you don't mind me asking, what has come over you, Mr D?
They think you did it.
Oh, my god.
Take the credit, they'll never know.
This feels good.
This feels quite good.
I'm going to take the credit.
It might come as a surprise to you, Paul, but I do have a heart.
I have some news about Green.
I'll give you news about Green.
He now knows who's boss.
He was snivelling like a baby begging for forgiveness.
It was embarrassing. We're not going to be hearing from Mr Green for a while.
I'm not sure if that's the case, Mr D.
Whilst you've been sleeping, we've been busy.
If Lord John's boys know where the powder is, they took it to the grave.
We know Green's behind everything.
He took your powder, not Lord John.
He's been playing games with us, and he's been playing games with you.
Fear me. Fear me.
Shut up.
Fear me.
Shut up.
Fear me.
It doesn't look good.
Shut up.
It doesn't look good.
The drums have been talking.
And what have the drums been saying?
They've been saying what Sam Gold's been hearing.
Fear me.
Hearing about the little problems Mr Green has been giving us, that's embarrassing.
We have an address for his brother.
We can take care of it.
Get him to talk, do whatever it takes.
Take Sorter and an army.
If they give any trouble, hurt 'em.
Let me read about that in the paper.
Get a hold of Green and get my powder.
Go.
Are we expecting anyone?
I'll get it.
I said, are we expecting anyone?
Shouldn't you check first?
If you love your daddy, be a good girl, hide in that cupboard.
Now.
Check the house.
You know why we're here?
Serpent.
I said, do you know why we're here?
I've some kind of an idea, yes.
Are you going to tell me?
Paul, I swear to you, I haven't got a fucking clue where he is.
He's been moving about.
I swear to you, I have no idea where he is.
It's all right.
That's it. That's better. That's better.
I still don't believe you.
You can't trust anyone.
They're out to destroy me.
They're out to destroy you.
You can't trust anyone.
I can't trust anyone.
Can't let Gold down.
He'll finish the business.
Then he'll finish me.
He's coming.
I won't see it coming.
He's coming. And I won't see it coming.
There's a woman here to see you, Mr D.
Said she cannot wait.
Don't tell me her name.
Says she works for Gold.
Don't tell me her name. Anyone but her.
What's her name?
Walker.
Anyone but her.
And everybody thought you were such a disgusting man, Mr Macha.
Here it comes. Here it comes.
Mr Gold wishes to extend his respect for such a magnanimous gesture.
But he was wondering That's a wreath.
That's a fucking wreath. if you can afford the time to give so generously, why you haven't had time to conclude our business?
Everything's under control. I need more time.
It's anything but under control, isn't it, Mr Macha?
Mr Gold doesn't give more time.
And he doesn't give second chances.
You will be hearing from him.
Good day.
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?
What the fuck does that mean?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Some fucking street hustler?
If he wants to meet me, you send him here and we'll see what he has to say.
I'll kill 'em, I'll kill all of 'em.
I'll kill 'em first.
They'll kill us first, they'll fucking annihilate me.
Beg, beg. Take it back, beg, beg.
Beg, you idiot.
Wait, wait. I didn't mean what I just said.
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?
That means he's going to end my game and I won't see it coming.
I'm going to make this fair.
This is for you.
These for me.
One good chop, and you'll make the sink.
OK, that's enough.
Question me again, Sorter, and we will have a falling out.
Tell me what's happening, Lou.
I got tired of waiting by the car, so I went inside.
Paul, he was getting excited, you know how he does.
He started messing with the little girl's hair.
Out of nowhere, Sorter shot him.
Your daddy loves you so much.
Shot who?
Paul.
Then he turned the gun on the two bodyguards, both gone in a blink of an eye.
Listen to me, sweetheart.
None of this is real.
It's just a game that the grown-ups are playing.
Now what I want you to do, I want you to get in the cupboard and I want you to put your fingers in your ears, and it'll be all over before you know it.
Do as the man says, babe.
Put your fingers in your ears and go in the cupboard.
Good girl.
Pull yourself together, man.
Sorter, we're going to have to take the girl.
Of course you have.
Now all you've got to do is come and get her.
I'm the only one left.
Where's the girl?
What are we doing here?
One last treat, and bring the powder.
Jake Green is in the Casino.
How the fuck does he know?
Why are we here?
You have a meeting.
Got a little time to spare.
Let's have a game.
Bring him up.
You know what's so elegant about this little game, Jake?
Nobody knows where the enemy is.
They don't even know he exists.
He's in every one of their heads.
And they trust him because they think they are him.
If you try to destroy him to save them, they'll destroy you to save him.
It's beautiful, man.
You have to admire the opponent's elegance.
Check.
You're quite good at this game, Mr Green.
I know because I'm quite good at this game.
Check.
Check.
Check.
The art is for me to feed pieces to you, and make you believe you took those pieces, because you're smarter and I'm dumber.
Checkmate.
Wake up, Mr Green.
You can't see what's right in front of you.
I never saw or spoke to those boys in all those years, but you know I would have died for either one of them.
One was a chess master, the other a master conman.
Dangerous combination, chess and cons.
Those two knew everything about me.
All my dirty little secrets, how much money I had, where I kept it.
Hustling bastards cleaned me out.
My neighbours used to write down chess moves and concepts of the con in the back pages of books based on subjects like The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.
Wake up, Mr Green.
We were all going to go together, they swore to me.
You're coming with us, Jake.
We were always going to take you with us, Jake.
You just weren't ready to hear how hard that was going to be.
We didn't do this because we like you.
We did this because we are you.
Time for that meeting.
Give him what he wants.
I'm sure that will make him very happy.
I know you're still there, cos I can feel you dying.
I can hear you, tapping me for a little nutrition.
Now who's clucking for a fix?
Think it's a little tight in here, do you?
You're not wrong, cos the walls are moving in.
No food here, not today, sunshine.
My eyes are open and the restaurant's closed.
Jog on, slide off.
Find someone else to fill your pipe, someone who won't see you coming or know when you're there.
You think I'm an evil man.
You think I am an evil man, don't you?
Rachel, look at me, honey.
Think I don't know your fucking game?
I do, I know your game, I see your game, I am your game.
Rachel, look at me, baby.
You don't play by the rules, Mr Green.
You like to play silly games with my head, don't you?
You're a fucking survivor, A winner.
You're a pussy drowning in his own shit.
Shut up and leave me alone.
He chose his hiding place very carefully.
I can't let him kill me.
You're weak. It's too late.
You're a dead man anyway.
You'll be dead before dawn.
The word "excuse" does not exist in Sam Gold's lexicon.
This is Sam Gold I found myself chained to.
Mr Black Magic.
Mr "l-run-this-game" Gold.
We can't see Gold.
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.
No-one gets away from Gold.
Get control of yourself.
It's anything but under control, isn't it, Mr Macha?
He's going to kill me, he'll kill me.
Where's your pride? Where's your pride?
I'd rather kill myself than let him kill me.
Why isn't he scared? He's just staring at me.
You'll be hearing from him.
But he can't kill a dead man.
But he can't kill a dead man, can he?
He can't kill a dead man, can he?
You can't even do it, can you?



You haven't been goingto your G.A. meetings.
The department mandated six.
I did my six.
I haven't laid a bet in three months.
Bonded forever by what we went through.
Do you remember going to visit Mr.
Dalton in jail three weeks ago?
Hello.
What is it?
Felicia broke into the bank.
I know that I made the 9-1-1 call.
How could you not tell me?
I'm pregnant.
I take my responsibility very seriously.
Why do you keep on coming here?
You've become important to me.
It might do you some good to really be where you are.
That sounds a lot like something you might say to someone you're ina relationship with.
Look, I know what you went through together.
No, I don't think you do.
Do you even have any idea what you are getting into with this guy?
Is there something we all need to talk about?
What happened in there?
Hour 2 - 4:27 PM None of you people smoke?
I don't have any.
Well, Tom, you look a little better.
How do you feel?
My head hurts.
All right, you've still got to stay down, okay? Take it easy.
It's mine.
Lizzie It's mine.
I told you to turn it off.
I know.
I got it.
Uh... uh, I-I can... wait.
Somebody needs to get me a damn cigarette.
Forget the cigarette.
Please just stop that damn phone!
What's that you say?
I can't hear you.
Please don't. She's having You don't want to keep 'em hanging.
Shut up, cop.
You got a team full of negotiators out there ready to work for you.
Ask 'em for a car, a chopper, a private plane, whatever you want.
Somehow I don't think I'm gonna get whatever I want.
You start sending out hostages, you will.
Nobody's leaving here before we do.
You got ten people in here.
Send out one, get some smokes.
It's one less person to cover.
Give up a hostage for a pack of cigarettes?
Ask for something you want, see if they're gonna cooperate.
At least start the process.
Otherwise, we're all gonna be sitting here staring at each other until we run out of time.
We want to make a trade.
Cigarettes and some food.
We'll give you one.
No, we'll decide.
So who wants out, huh?
Step right up!
Hey, we should talk about this.
No, no! Let's see what they think.
Any volunteers?
The security guard. Wounded go first.
Security guard stays.
Come on. Don't be shy.
Who wants out?
Mother, don't say anything.
Hey, Randall.
What?
It's a democracy.
How about a show of hands?
But he's hurt.
Just put your hand up.
So you want out?
Of course she wants out.
We all want out.
Take my sister!
She has a little boy at home.
Sisters, huh?
Well, we are definitely not separating you two.
Then send 'em both.
That's two less people you gotta worry about.
Nobody asked you, cop.
That's enough!
Hey, ty-d bol man, How about you?
You want out?
What, you don't care?
You don't want to be free?
I think you should let somebody else go, one of the women.
Children are first to go.
My  daughter's back there somewhere.
She should go.
Try that one.
Felicia, honey.
It's okay. It's okay, baby.
It's okay.
Come on out.
Everything's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Look at me. I promise, okay?
Come on with me so we can get you home.
It's all right, baby.
You're goin' home.
We got her.
What the hell was she doing in here?
She was hiding. It's all right.
So you want to send her?
She's a kid.
Yeah, a kid with a pink cell phone.
La dee dah.
You're the one who did this?
Now wait a minute.
Dad... Dad She didn't know what she was doing.
All those cops out there pointing their guns at us We would have been out of here by now!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
God!
There is no way we're sending her out, 'cause she is what's gonna keep the big man in line.
Hold on.
The cops already know she's in here.
They would have traced her cell.
The best way to earn yourself some good will, send out a kid.
We gotta get this cop outta here.
Now wait a minute.
Just wait a minute!
I have been on the other side of these standoffs.
I know exactly what they're thinking out there.
I know exactly what their next move's gonna be.
You got a *** out there.
Out there just dying to take over from the negotiators, and I am the guy that can keep them working with you.
You need me in here.
He's right!
I mean, we've all seen the movies.
If they've got a cop in here, they're less likely to come in with their guns blazing.
Now if you're not gonna take the injured guy, you're  not gonna take the girl, take her. What's your name?
Uh, Na-Nancy hale.
Take Nancy.
She's the oldest.
That's gonna win you points out there.
Besides, she's been driving you crazy since this whole thing started.
Tie me up if you want to, handcuff me.
But keep me in here.

Hey.
Making up a little, uh, tortilla soup.
So you, uh, never came home last night.
I was on a stakeout.
Ah.
I called the station a couple of times, left some messages.
Egan, you had a wife.
I had a wife.
We got rid of 'em.
Let's not be wives.
Just  a concerned friend not a wife.
I thought you were looking for your own place. How's that going?
Stalled for the moment.
The geo's in the shop.

All right, I got it. I got it.
Cavanaugh residence.
Hey, Egan. It's Kathryn.
Kathryn Hale Ho ho.
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?
Well, actually I was hoping to get ahold of Nick.
Oh, of course.
Uh, yeah, he's right her hold on.
Oh, uh, wait a second.
By the way, I'm having some people over to play poker here tomorrow night.
I don't, uh, suppose you'd be available?
Oh, I wish I could, but I actually have this thing with Ed.
Well, whata grave disappointment.
Here's the man.
A poker party?
Yeah, I found your chips.
I figured, "Hey, you play!" How's it going?
Okay. You?
Working hard, you know?
So you know what? Listen I know that this is not the most brilliant timing, but my mother has been after me every day about this lunch thing, you know, so she can finally thank you.
If you, you know, if you have it in you for another hero ceremony Yeah, I think I can manage it.
Really?
If it'll lighten your load.
Uh, god, thank you.
I can be there asa buffer if you need me.
Uh, please.
Uh, how about tomorrow around 1:00 at the, uh, Orange Tree café on third?
With bells on.
Good.
All right, I'll see you then.
I'll see you.
What's with the alarm?
Mom said it's been going off all day.
I tried that. Yeah, could you just send someone out here?
I'm off in a minute.
What are you reading?
Schoolwork on a friday night, huh?
Well, what else am I supposed to do?
I'm under house arrest.
Well, that's what happens when you lie to us, young lady, so no pouting.
Dinner's ready to go on the stove, baby.
And you can just order something for tomorrow.
We will be fine.
Just have a good trip and make sure you call as soon as you get there, okay?
And the alarm company's supposed to call back. I left the number.
I got it.
Okay, I love you. Mm.
I love you, too.
Be good now.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
How long is this gonna last?
Felicia, you went to a men's prison.
Then you broke into the bank.
I think we've got every reason in the world to keep you around for a while.
Come on now.
It doesn't have to be that bad, spending the weekend with your father, does it?
Let's have some dinner.
I'm Lizzie Miller.
I was hoping to see Lucas.
Lift your arms for me.
Don't you need to ask him if it's okay?
He's been expecting you.
Can I help?
That's okay. I got it.
I just found out they're moving you back to county.
Day after tomorrow.
Should be a party.
They let me in.
They said you were expecting me?
Yeah. I was.
A couple weeks ago.
The D.A.'s office told us not to have any contact with you, that it could hurt the case.
But you came anyway?
Well, I appreciate what you did.
We all do.
Ambassador of the group, just passing on the message.
What do you want me to say?
Nothing.
You said your piece.
You're good to go.
All right, well, just make sure that gets filed tonight, and send me the e-mail, and I'll look over it.
Thanks... Thanks, Rachel.
I'll, uh I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
Hey there.
Hey.
You, uh You said "dinner." You didn't say that you were decorating.
Champagne?
Mm-hmm. Take this.
Give me this.
Thank you.
Ed, what is What is all this?
We've been at this for four years now.
We've danced around each other.
We've gone full throttle, half throttle.
Sometimes I wanted to throttle you.
But something happened to me when I got the call that you were one of the people inside that bank, when I had to confront the possibility of living the rest of my life without you.
Two days later, when you came walking out of there and back to me I promised myself that I would never risk losing you again.
I'm sorry. I'm... Excuse me.
Now if you're not gonna take the injured guy, you're not gonna take the girl, take her. What's your name?
Na-Nancy Hale.
Take Nancy. She's the oldest.
That's gonna win you points out there.
Besides, she's been driving you crazy since this whole thing started.
Tie me up if you want to, handcuff me.
But keep me in here.
Showtime, lady. Let's go!
I'm so sorry I called you.
You shouldn't even be here.
It's all right, mom.
Get back.
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine, okay?
She's coming out.
First she rings the stuff back, hands if off at the door, then we let her go.
You got that?
Wait a minute.
She needs her purse.
She needs her purse.
Just give me one minute Katie! Let her go!
Mom, mom!
My baby!
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine!
No, let her go!
Mom, you're gonna be fine!
Let her go. Let her go!
Let go of me!
One more word out of you, lady!
One more word!
Don't do this to me!
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.
Don't do this to me!
She can't hear you.
It's okay.
Tell  me what's happening.
It's okay. She's going.
What is it?
Everything's fine.
She's almost there.
She's being very brave.
What the hell is she doing?
Now what?
Everything is fine.
She's just getting the stuff.
No.
No No, Katie!
No, no, no! What the hell?
Please, let me go!
What the hell?
What is happening?
Stay with me!
You've got to let me go, please!
God!
It's okay. They've got her.
They've got her. It's fine.
Don't!
Damn it!
She's okay. She's fine.
Damn She's safe. She's safe.
I'm sorry to call you in on a Saturday.
If you would renew my prescription over the phone, then I would Well, I thought this wasa nice opportunity to catch up since I haven't heard from you in over a mon.
Anything big happen?
Lydia, look, I already told you, I don't want to talk about the bank.
I don't want to talk about anything.
I just need more Zenatan.
Kathryn What?
What's going on?
Ed proposed to me last night.
Or  tried to, and then I I just I couldn't breathe.
He started to say the words, and I just... I couldn't I couldn't get any air.
And what happened?
I hid in the bathroom until I was calm and then By the time I came out to apologize Ed was incredibly understanding as always, and he just I don't know, he said we could table it.
So things are Yeah, back to normal, whatever that means.
Have you been having the attacks again since the bank?
No, actually that that one was the first.
So what we're saying is, bank trauma, no problem, marriage proposal, big problem?
It's not marriage.
Then what? Is it Ed?
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.
There is someone from the bank.
I've only known him for a couple weeks, but I've been thinking about him, which is so ridiculous, because I've known Ed for four years!
And I go through this thing with this guy for two days, and I Well, let's be honest.
You've always been ambivalent about Ed, and I never thought it had anything to do with Ed.
But that's the thing is that since the bank, I have been open to Ed and needing Ed.
And it's been okay.
But then there's this other man.
Yeah.
Nick.
Hello?
Hey Franny, how's it going?
It's Jeremy.
Hey, what's up?
I was just checking in to see if you got invited to that poker game over at Nick's tonight.
Yeah, Egan called, but I don't really play cards, though, so... I don't know.
Yeah, same here.
Oh.
But there's this party over at my neighbor's house. It's a charity thing.
He's a music industry guy.
I think it'll be pretty fun.
I was, well, wondering if you'd want to go.
Um, sure.
That'd be cool.
All right.
Well, it starts around 10:00.
I was thinking that maybe I could pick you up around 8:00 and, uh and we could grab some dinner first, unless you wanted to just meet me there.
No, no, no.
Dinner would be great.
Okay, great.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Thanks again for doing this.
It means a lot to her.
Hey, it's a step up from the diner.
Oh, I'm supposed to say hello from Egan.
He's, uh, pretty devastated you're not coming to this thing tonight.
Thank you.
Poker, huh?
Yeah.
No, I-I just was a little surprised.I didn't think that you did that anymore.
Look, whatever you heard from Ed was overstated.
Thank you.
Oh, thanks.
I  had a bad period last year after my divorce.
I made a few mistakes, played with some people I shouldn't have, but that's it. It's over.
Anyway, it was Egan's idea.
We're playing for nickels.
You should come.
Oh, I am so sorry.
Hi.
The driver insisted on taking the 405.
Oh, well.
Ah, good.
Thank you, Enrique.
We'll have the champagne now.
Oh, mom, that's not really necessary.
Well, you're not on duty, are you?
Nope. Day off.
Good, then I insist. I'm appallingly overdue in paying tribute to this man's heroism, and I intend to do so properly.
You know, I'm not sure I deserve to be Uh, ah, ah, ah.
I will havene of your modesty.
You were coolheaded and shrewd, certainly more so than those flak-jacketed brutes that dragged me off the plaza.
Aha, here we are.
Oh, this is lovely.
Yeah? Well Thank you.
To detective Nicholas Cavanaugh, who saved my life, and to my daughter Kathryn, who is finally beginning hers.
What are you talking about?
Oh, dear.
Did things not go as planned? I I'm sorry. Did I miss something?
Oh, I just... I Mother, mother, mother, we'll discuss it later.
They have a great crab salad here.
Don't take me!
Don't come near me!
You understand?
Because they're gonna shoot my daughter in there if you come near me in any way!
Okay?
Oh, dad!
Trojans beat Oregon!
I can smell the roses. Come on, let's go to the homecoming rally.
No, I gotta finish this book.
You know, you used to beg me to take you to those things when I'd take your brothers.
You'd even do the Trojan cheer for me.
Yeah, I was like 10.
Honey, you have had your nose in this thing all day.
It's time for you to take a break with your old man.
If you're nice to me, I'll give you a sip of my beer.
What about mom?
I forwarded all the calls to my cell phone.
Get your shoes on.
Let's go, come on!
It's not like I'm asking fora penthouse, a house in bel-air.
For 2 grand a month, a person should be entitled  some light, some space.
The one in century city wasn't bad.
It was century city adjacent at best.
How about the one in north Hollywood?
That had plenty of light.
Right on the 134?
All the noise, the pollution?
Egan, it's not like you're gonna retire there.
No, but I might want to entertain occasionally.
You know, maybe get a regular poker game going, huh?
You'd better hurry.
There's a car coming at 6:00.
You know, I just want to know why my mother casually let it drop that we were celebrating my engagement.
Well, that must have been awkward given the circumstances.
I mean, what did you do, ask for my hand in marriage when you know how I feel about my mother? I mean, what is this, the '50s?
Were the two of you working out my dowry?
Right, your mother that's the issue here.
No, Ed, the issue is that it's more important to you that everybody thinks you're swell than it is to show me fundamental respect and consideration.
"Respect and consideration"?
You know, it makes me wonder.
I mean, do you have any idea who I am or what it is that I want?
You don't know what you want, which is why you came over here to pick a fight with me, so you don't have to deal with yourself.
Don't put this on me.
No, this one's all you.
Now, I love you, Kat.
You know I do.
But I put myself out there, and you literally ran away.
Now putting my feelings aside... which, by the way, is kind of a pattern here putting my feelings aside, you need to get clear on what you're doing, because if we're not moving forward, I don't know where we're going anymore.
You can let yourself out.
Do you usually go to the bathroom this much?
I'm nervous.
Yeah, well, I can't keep walking you back here.
This is the last time.
I'm pregnant.
That's why.
Don't let Randall find out.
I won't.
I mean it.
It won't be good if he finds out.
Why?
Just trust me.
And nobody else should find out either.
And tell your boyfriend not to say anything.
He won't.
He doesn't know yet.
What's your name?
Lucas.
Thank you, Lucas.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, it's okay.
Uh, I was just headed out.
Cologne?
Yeah, I gotta go to this charity thing.
You have a date?
I thought it was a little too soon for full disclosure.
No, it is... too soon.
Well, I'm running late.
I should go.
Have a good time.
Do you have an open seat?
You're the first one here.
Where is everyone?
Egan's out getting ice or, uh, guacamole.
Can I get you something?
Uh, yeah, I'll take one of those bad boys. Thanks.
I thought you had a thing with Ed.
Yeah, last-minute change of plans.
Lucky for us.
Thanks.
You see something you want to put on?
Uh, you pick.
I didn't know you had a sister.
That's my ex-wife.
Oh.
Wow, she's really pretty.
It's a good picture of my mom.
Ed... Ed proposed to me.
Wow.
Was that the, uh, second half of your mom's toast?
Yeah, apparently.
Good for you.
Well, I haven't answered him yet.
Really?
But he's a good guy.
Well, I'm kind of a commitment-phobe.
Aren't we all?
Kathryn Hale! Hey!
Hey! Hi.
My evening is complete.
Hey, and look who I found outside.
Hey, there.
Hey, you made it with the whole family.
Yep, well, I figure she's off to college soon.
She might as well learn how to play cards, right?
And gene's coming, too.
We're gonna have a full house.
Egan, I cannot get enough of this guacamole. What is in this?
Some call it cilantro.
I call it fiesta. Call.
2 pair. Kings and 7s.
Trip 6s. Is this good?
Let me see. You got four, no, five jacks with a wild card.
Honey, that means you won.
You're a natural-born genius.
All right, here we go.
Get your money, babe.
Sweet innocence.
It's your mother.
Sit out the next hand.
Um, hey, honey.
Come on, Egan. It's your deal.
Um, we're just, uh, taking it easy, you know?
Lying to the wife about poker.
Very old-school.
No, it's not lying.
It's bluffing.
Hey, she's learning.
Very nice.
Okay, uh, 7-card stud. Ante up.
And deuces, one-eyed jacks wild.
Oh, come on.
Playing with two wild cards is not poker.
Who's up fora round of hold'em?
$5, $10 blinds.
Cavanaugh's getting restless.
All right.
I'm sorry I was out of line with you before.
I'm just scared about everything I have to face.
I know.
I guess you are, too.
I don't know what I am lately.
It all got turned upside down, didn't it?
Yeah.
Can I get you anything?
It is your last night.
You could sit with me.
I am really sorry for dragging you to that thing. Those people Somehow I don't think they were all there for animal rescue, huh?
You think?
Did you see that one lady in the leather pantsuit?
I mean, come on.
How many cows do you think were killed to make that thing?
Oh, wait.
What? What?
You said "pantsuit." Who says "pantsuit"?
Shut up.
Pantsuit. My mother used to wear those.
You are such a white boy.
Do that dance move for me again.
What, do you mean this one?
Oh, no.
I had a really good time tonight.
Me, too.
This is the most uncomplicated I've felt in a long time.
Are we really doing this?
Nick's got cards.
Scared.
Not yet.
Call.
Calling and flopping.
Two ladies showing.
Check.
What?
Do you think they changed on you?
I'm jumping off this train, boys.
You can't handle it.
10 and raise 10.
Check, raise. Very sly.
Too hot for me.
I'm getting out of the kitchen.
What do you have, my friend?
Well, there is one more queen besides the one in your hand, and I think I have the better kicker.
Mm.
Your thoughts, milady?
You can hang.
Here goes nothing.
Fourth street.
I think you're bluffing.
Then raise me.
I will.
Reraise.
Raise you back.
This is a rush.
What do you say we go no limit?
Bring it on, my friend.
Guys, come on. What are you doing?
We're playing cards.
$240. I'm all in.
All right. Um I got $180 on the table.
Um, do you accept cash?
Why not?
All right, let's see $20, $40 and $60. Okay.
This is ridiculous.
Okay, alpha dogs.
Let's see 'em.
Three sisters.
I hit my straight. Sorry, bud.
Whoa Wow. Burned by lady luck.
I should have known.
I'm playing with a shark.
Wait a minute, you were You were betting on a straight draw?
I got my lucky 7.
Yeah, but that was the last card.
I mean, you should have dropped out after the flop.
You had nothing, and you kept on raising?
I was bluffing.
Yeah, but you knew had three queens.
I won the hand, didn't I?
Is there a problem?
No, no, no. It's it's fine. Whatever.
Uh, anyone up for some more, uh, guacamole?
There was this card game last night at Nick's, and there was this moment where he won this really big hand, and there was just something about it that made me snap.
How do you mean?
I don't know. I got I got really angry.
I don't know why.
He could have lost everything, and then he just happened to get the right card.
And maybe that's great card-playing, but it's just It's like this guy is willing to bet everything on a wing a prayer and just kind of hope it works out?
I mean, this is crazy!
What was I even doing there?
What do you think you were doing there?
I don't know.
I'm wondering why this is suddenly so urgent for you.
Well, because Ed is Well, he's kind of thrown down the gauntlet.
I-I think I've, uh I've finally pushed him to his limit.
So... this may be a fork in the road?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Why am I resisting someone that I have loved for four years, who has been there for me again and again?
Well, you and Nick went through something incredibly powerful together.
It's not easily dismissed.
Yeah.
I used... I used to take these walks on the beach when I was kid, and I would I would pick up the brightest shells, the ones with the strongest greens and purples and reds.
And then when I got home, I'd put them on the windowsill, and they just I don't know.
They seemed pale and dusty, you know, like they couldn't They couldn't survive outside the saltwater.
Is that how you feel about Nick?
That he can't survive out in the world?
That what we had inside the bank won't survive outside in the world.
Hey!
Do not move.
Cuff the post first.
That's fine. Now me.
That's fine. Not so tight.
I'm sorry.
Thanks for speaking up before about keeping me in. It helped.
You... move!
I think we all feel better having you here.
All right, come on.
Morning.
Hey, uh, sorry. I was hoping to finish by the time you got up.
No sweat. It's been worse.
There's coffee.
Are you, uh, actually going to apply to this hellhole?
Oh, I wouldn't call it a hellhole.
More like a mousehole.
Look, this is ridiculous.
Take back the money.
I'm not taking the money.
I don't want it.
You won it fair and square!
I was an ass last night, okay?
I pushed you into it.
I wasn't pushed.
I was playing poker.
It was actually surprisingly thrilling, worth every penny, and if you keep trying to give me back the money, then I am gonna feel like the ass.
Oh, Nick, come on.
You just paid your first month's rent.
Keep looking for a place, but in the meantime, stick around If you don't mind the couch.
Okay.
Thank you.
You know, you're the only one who knows What happened between me and Jeremy.
You haven't talked to anybody about it?
I haven't even talked to him about it.
There's really nothing between us now but... silence.
And a child.
What happens when someone's pointing a gun at you is not who you are.
I can tell you that.
Ed?
Hey.
Hey.
I let myself in.
How was the mayor?
Mayoral.
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
I'm sorry I've been such an idiot.
I guess you've been reconsidering the part about not wanting to lose me twice.
Well, maybe I never had you.
Eddie, I been thinking about it a lot, and I I know I have been all over the place, but for what it's worth, I feel clear now, and I know that you probably feel that you can't trust that, but I want you to try.
What does that mean, "try"?
Will you do me the honor of finishing what you were asking me the other night?
Please.
I wasn't planning on doing this in my underwear.
Kathryn Hale Will you marry me?
Oh, my god.
That ring, that's That's my grandmother's ring.
Where did you get that?
Ah, your mother, god bless her, said to me very early on that if I ever wanted to take things to the next level, she had the ring.
So last week, I called her and said I was ready.
Ooh. What's that for?
It's good to have you home.
Oh, I should go away more often.
Mm.
What'd you and Felicia do?
That girl is positively sparkling.
Well, nothing special.
Just a good time with her dad.
Not too many left before she's off to college.
So you, uh, ever hear back from the alarm company?
Oh, yeah, they came by. Said it was a broken window sensor or something.
So they fixed it?
Supposedly.
'Cause I don't want Ms.
Fisher to start complaining.
Where are my keys?
Honey, you seen my keys?


But what about Jean?
What about her illness?
Illness?
John.
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?
Perhaps it would be best if we were to speak to her. Alone.
Of course.
Jean, can you come down, dear?
We'll leave you, then.
It's very rude to read my thoughts, or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.
Did you think you were the only one of your kind, young lady?
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.
Really? I doubt that.
Oh, Charles.
I like this one.
You have more power than you can imagine, Jean.
The question is, will you control that power?
Or let it control you?
Warren? Son, is everything all right?
What's going on?
Nothing. I'll be right out.
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.
Open the door. Warren.
One second!
Open this door.
Warren.
Let me in there right now. Open the door.
Oh, God.
Not you.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Not you.
Dad, I'm sorry.
The whole world's going to hell and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.
Bobby!
Thanks, Kitty.
We're getting killed out here.
Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.
Logan.
Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.
That was my last cigar.
Logan.
It's getting closer.
Come on. Let's keep moving.
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.
How's your throwing arm?
Logan, we work as a team.
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.
Class dismissed.
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.
Simulation complete.
What was that?
Danger room session.
You know what I mean.
Lighten up.
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.
I taught 'em something.
It was a defensive exercise.
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?
This isn't a game, Logan.
Well, you sure fooled me.
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.
Scott!
Jean.
Scott. Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
Are you OK?
I'm fine.
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.
I can't touch my boyfriend without killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.
They were looking for you. You didn't show. - What do you care?
For starters, I had to cover your ass.
I didn't ask you to.
No, you didn't. The professor did.
I was just passing through.
So pass through, Logan.
Hey, look.
I know how you feel. When Jean died Don't.
Maybe it's time for us to move on.
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.
Mr. Secretary.
Yes.
The meeting's begun, sir.
Thank you.
Mr. President.
Have a seat, Hank.
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border, but we did get a consolation prize.
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.
Yes, sir. She can do that.
Not any more, she can't. We got her.
You think your prisons can hold her?
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.
Where is Magneto?
Raven?
Raven, I asked you a question.
I don't answer to my slave name.
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?
Or has he convinced you you don't have a family any more?
My family tried to kill me, you pathetic meat sack.
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?
In here with us.
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.
You don't want to play games with me?
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?
You wanna know where he is?
Homo sapien.
You know, her capture will only provoke Magneto, but having her does give us some diplomatic leverage.
On principle, I can't negotiate with these people.
I thought that's why you appointed me, sir. - Yes, it is.
But that's not why you called me here.
No. This is.
It's what she stole from the FDA.
Dear Lord.
Is it viable?
We believe it is.
You realize the impact this'll have on the mutant community?
Yes. I do. That's precisely why we need some of your diplomacy now.
When an individual acquires great power, the use or misuse of that power is everything.
Will it be for the greater good or will it be used for personal or for destructive ends?
Now, this is a question we must all ask ourselves.
Why? Because we are mutants.
For psychics, this presents a particular problem.
When is it acceptable to use our power and when do we cross that invisible line that turns us into tyrants over our fellow man?
But Einstein said that ethics are an exclusive human concern without any superhuman authority behind it.
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.
This case study was sent to me by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.
The man you see here was born with no higher-level brain functions.
His organs and nervous system work, but he has no consciousness to speak of.
What if we were to transfer the consciousness of one person, say a father of four with terminal cancer, into the body of this man?
How are we to decide what falls within the range of ethical behavior and what Professor?
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.
The forecast was for sunny skies.
I'm sorry.
I don't have to be psychic to see that something's bothering you.
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive, we've a mutant in the cabinet, a president who understands us - why hide?
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.
Yes, but we can't be students forever.
Storm, I haven't thought of you as my student for years.
In fact, I thought that perhaps you might take my place some day.
But Scott's Scott's a changed man.
He took Jean's death so hard.
Yes, things are better out there, but you, of all people, know how fast the weather can change.
There's something you're not telling us.
Hank?
Ororo. Charles.
I love what you've done with your hair.
You too. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.
I have news.
Is it Eric?
No. Though we have been making some progress on that front.
Mystique was recently apprehended.
Who's the fur ball?
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.
Henry, this is Logan. He's Wolverine.
I hear you're quite an animal.
Look who's talking.
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.
A major pharmaceutical company has developed a mutant antibody.
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.
Suppress?
Permanently.
They're calling it a cure.
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.
Scientifically speaking When did we become a disease?
Storm.
They're announcing it now.
These so-called mutants are people just like us.
Their affliction is nothing more than a disease, a corruption of healthy cellular activity.
But I stand here today to tell you that there's hope.
This site, once the world's most famous prison, will now be the source of freedom for all mutants who choose it.
Ladies and gentlemen I proudly present the answer to mutation.
Finally, we have a cure.
Who would want this cure? I mean, what kind of coward would take itjust to fit in?
Is it cowardice to save oneself from persecution?
Not all of us can fit in so easily.
You don't shed on the furniture.
The government probably cooked this up.
The government had nothing to do with it.
I've heard that before.
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights since before you had claws.
Did he just call me boy?
Is it true? They can cure us?
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.
No. Professor.
They can't cure us.
You wanna know why? Because there's nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.
Or any of us, for that matter.
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.
We need to put together a committee and talk to the government.
They don't understand. They don't know what it means to be a mutant.
We need to show them, educate them, let them know that we're here to stay.
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously They wanna exterminate us.
This cure is voluntary.
Nobody is talking about extermination.
No one ever talks about it.
They just do it.
And you'll go on with your lives ignoring the signs all around you.
And then one day, when the air is still and the night has fallen, they come for you.
Then you realize, while you're talking about organizing and committees, the extermination has already begun.
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.
They will force their cure upon us.
The only question is, will you join my brotherhood and fight?
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?
Who will you stand with? The humans?
Or us?
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.
Back off.
If you're so proud of being a mutant, where's your mark?
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.
You know who you're talking to?
Do you?
And what can you do?
So you have talents?
That and more. I know you control metal.
And I know there's 87 mutants in here, none above a class three.
Other than you two.
You can sense other mutants and their powers?
Could you locate one for me?
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.
Oh, Mr. President.
Shut up.
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.
Please.
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.
When I get out of here, I'm going to kill you myself.
Yeah, right.
Secretary McCoy, welcome to Worthington Labs.
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.
It's the safest location we could find. That's why we keep the source of the cure here.
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.
We are in compliance with your policy.
How long will you keep the boy here?
Until we can fully map his DNA. We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.
And his power? What is its range?
You'll see.
Jimmy.
There's someone I would like you to meet.
Hello there, son.
Hi.
My name is Hank McCoy.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.
Extraordinary, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
Stop.
I'm here. Scott. Scott.
Stop it.
Scott. Scott.
Stop it.
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.
Stop!
Jean?
Scott.
How?
I don't know.
I wanna see your eyes.
Take these off.
No.
No.
Trust me. I can control it now.
Open them. You can't hurt me.
What happened?
No clue.
Professor, are you OK?
Get to Alkali Lake.
You don't want to be here.
Do you?
I can't see a damn thing.
I can take care of that.
What the Logan!
She's alive.
Jean.
The sheer mass of water that collapsed on top of Jean should have obliterated her.
The only explanation of Jean's survival is that her powers wrapped her in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.
Is she gonna be OK?
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious part of her mind and therein lay the danger.
When she was a girl, I created a series of psychic barriers to isolate her powers from her conscious mind.
Jean developed a dual personality. - What?
The conscious Jean, whose powers were always in her control, and the dormant side.
A personality that, in our sessions, came to call itself the Phoenix.
A purely instinctual creature, all desire and joy and rage.
She knew all this?
It's unclear how much she knew.
Far more critical is whether the woman in front of us is the Jean Grey we know, or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.
She looks peaceful to me.
I'm keeping her that way.
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks and cage the beast again.
What have you done to her?
You have to understand You're talking about a person's mind.
She has to be controlled.
Controlled?
Sometimes, when you cage the beast, the beast gets angry.
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.
I don't have to explain myself, least of all to you.
History will be made here today.
For the first time, the so-called mutant cure will be available to the public.
Reaction has run the gamut with mutants on both sides of the line.
Some are desperate for this cure while others are offended by the very idea of it.
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?
Hard to say. His political views seem somewhat at odds with his personal issues.
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.
Good. Bring him in.
Are you sure you want to start with him?
I think it's important. Yes.
Hello, Warren.
How are you, son?
Did you sleep well?
Yeah.
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.
You ready?
The transformation can be a little jarring.
Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
We've talked about it, son.
It'll all be over soon.
Everything's going to be fine.
Wait. I can't do this.
Warren, calm down.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
I can't do this.
Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.
I promise you it will be fine.
Warren, relax. - Dad.
Warren, it's a better life.
It's what we all want.
No.
It's what you want.
Warren, no!
Told you so.
About time.
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.
Without him, they have nothing.
Read off the guest list.
Cell 41205. James Madrox.  This one robbed seven banks.
At the same time.
I could use a man of your talents.
I'm in.
Welcome to the Brotherhood.
Careful with this one.
Cain Marko. Solitary confinement.  Check this out.
Prisoner must be confined at all times.  "If he builds any momentum, no object can stop him." How fascinating.
What do they call you?
Juggernaut.
I can't imagine why.
Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.
Nice helmet.
Keeps my face pretty.
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.
No!
You saved me.
Eric.
I'm sorry, my dear.
You're not one of us any more.
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.
Policy is being made without me, Mr. President.
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon was made without me.
What happened on that convoy was inexcusable. But your actions That was an isolated incident. You have to understand those mutants were a real threat.
Have you even begun to think what a slippery slope you're on?
I have.
And I worry about how democracy survives when one man can move cities with his mind.
As do I.
You and I know that it's only going to get worse.
All the more reason why I need to be where I belong.
Jean.
Hi, Logan.
Welcome back.
Back where we first met. Only I was in your place and you were in mine.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
More than OK.
Logan, you're making me blush.
You're reading my thoughts?
I don't have to.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Wait.
No.
Jean.
This isn't you.
Yes, it is me.
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.
The professor said you might be different.
He would know, wouldn't he?
What? You think he's not in your head too?
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.
Where's Scott?
Jean?
Where am I?
You're in the mansion.
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.
Jean, tell me what happened to him.
Oh, God.
Look at me.
Stay with me. Talk to me.
Look at me. Look at me.
No.
Focus. Focus, Jean.
Kill me.
What?
Kill me before I kill someone else.
Don't say that.
Please.
Stop it.
Kill me.
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.
It'll be all right. We can help you.
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.
I don't want to fix it.
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.
I told you they would draw first blood.
So what do we do?
What do we do?
We use this weapon as a lightning rod to bring countless more to our cause.
Come. We have an army to build.
I picked something up.
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.
It's a mutant.
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.
More powerful than you.
Where is she?
Logan.
Jean. Jean.
What happened?
What have you done?
I think she killed Scott.
What?
That's not possible.
I warned you.
She's left the mansion, but she's trying to block my thoughts. She's so strong.
It may be too late.
Wait for me here.
What?
I need to see Jean alone.
You were right, Charles.
This one is special.
What the hell are you doing here?
Same as the professor.
Visiting an old friend.
I don't want trouble here.
Nor do I.
So, shall we go inside?
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.
Just like old times, eh?
She needs help. Jean is not well.
Funny, you sound just like her parents.
Nobody gets inside.
I knew you'd come.
Of course. I've come to bring you home.
I have no home.
Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.
You know he thinks your power is too great for you to control.
I don't believe your mind games are going to work any more, Charles.
So you want to control me?
He does.
No. I want to help you.
Help me? What's wrong with me?
Absolutely nothing.
Eric, stop.
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.
For your own good, Jean.
Stay out of my head.
I'm going in.
The professor said he'd handle this.
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.
Get out of my head.
Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.
But I can help you.
I think you want to give her the cure.
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved because you couldn't control your power.
No! Stop it!
That's it.
Jean, let me in.
No, Jean.
Jean!
Don't let it control you.
Charles.
My dear. Come with me.
No.
God!
We live in an age of darkness.
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.
But in every age, there are those who fight against it.
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.
A world he tried to heal.
A mission he never saw accomplished.
It seems the destiny of great men to see their goals unfulfilled.
Charles was more than a leader, more than a teacher. He was a friend.
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.
He may be gone, but his teachings live on through us, his students.
Wherever we may go, we must carry on his vision.
And that's a vision of a world united.
Kitty.
Bobby.
You OK?
Yeah.
It's just... Xavier came to my house.
He was the one that convinced me to come here.
Yeah, me too.
We're all feeling the same way, you know.
No, Bobby, we're not.
You have Rogue and I have You know, I just miss home.
The first snow and all that.
Kitty, get up. Come with me.
Storm told us to stay in our rooms.
Don't worry. We won't get caught.
I mean, you can walk through walls, you know.
Come on.
This place can be home too.
Thank you for this, Bobby.
You need a lift, kid?
No.
Where are you going?
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.
Yeah, I do.
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.
A hug. A handshake.
A kiss.
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.
Look, if you wanna go, then go.
Just be sure it's what you want.
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?
To go upstairs and unpack?
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.
Just think about what I said, Rogue.
Marie.
Marie.
Remember when we first met? Do you know what I saw when I looked at you?
I saw the next stage in evolution both Charles and I dreamt of finding.
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles want to turn this goddess into a mortal?" I can manipulate the metal in this, but you, you can do anything.
Anything you can think of.
Jean.
Enough.
Enough.
You sound just like him.
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.
What do you want?
I want you to be what you are.
As nature intended.
That cure is meant for all of us. If we want freedom, we must fight for it.
And that fight begins now.
She shouldn't be here with us.
Her power is completely unstable.
Only in the wrong hands.
And you trust her? She's one of them.
So were you once.
I stuck with you. Would have killed the professor if you'd given me the chance.
Charles Xavier did more for mutants than you'll ever know.
My single greatest regret is that he had to die for our dream to live.
So what now? What do we do?
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.
We'll tell the students they're going home.
Most of us don't have anywhere to go.
I can't believe this. I can't believe we're not going to fight for this school.
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.
I was told that this was a safe place for mutants.
It was, son.
And it still is. We'll find you a room.
Hank, tell all the students the school stays open.
Rogue.
Hey, Rogue.
Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
Yeah, she took off.
Logan.
Logan.
Logan.
Jean?
Logan. Where am I? Logan.
Logan. Logan.
Logan.
Stop.
Logan. Logan. Logan.
Where are you going?
Where do you think?
She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
You don't know that.
She killed the professor.
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.
Listen, why can't you see the truth?
Why can't you just let her go?
Because... because Because you love her.
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.
So if you're with us, then be with us.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
Getting the cure so you can go back home to mommy and daddy?
I'm looking for someone.
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.
Come on, Iceman.
Make a move.
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.
Today's attack was only our first salvo.
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets will not be safe. You will not be safe.
And to my fellow mutants, I make you this offer Join us or stay out of our way.
Enough mutant blood has been spilled already.
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.
We cannot let him do this.
You know I agree, sir.
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.
I want troops armed with cure weapons deployed immediately.
And Trask, you have to find Magneto and stop him by any means necessary.
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.
Let's go. Keep it moving.
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.
Absolutely no metal.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition called homo sapiens.
They have their weapons.
We have ours.
We will strike with a vengeance anda fury that this world has never witnessed.
And if any mutants stand in our way, we will use this poison against them.
We shall go to Alcatraz Island, take control of the cure, and destroy its source.
And then nothing can stop us.
Jean.
I know the smell of your adamantium from a mile away.
I didn't come here to fight you.
Smart boy.
I came for Jean. - You think I'm keeping her against her will?
She's here because she wants to be.
You don't know what you're dealing with.
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.
And you stood there and let him die?
I'm not leaving here without her.
Yes, you are.
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.
We have a satellite feed of Magneto's base of operations.
How did we find it?
She gave us everything we wanted.
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
Approaching target dead ahead.
Set for 360-degree incursion.
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.
OK, send them in.
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!
OK. I give up.
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.
Are you sure the boy is still inside?
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.
Leave that to me.
Storm. Storm.
What are you doing back here?
I need help.
You found her.
Yeah. She's with Magneto.
Where are they?
On the move. I know where they're going.
You're saying you saw Magneto?
We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.
There are troops stationed on that island.
Not enough to stop him.
Let's suit up.
Hard to believe this once fit me. - If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.
Can you estimate how many he has?
An army. And Jean.
His powers have limits, hers do not.
There's only six of us, Logan.
Yeah. We're outnumbered.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
But we lost Scott.
We lost the professor.
If we don't fight now, everything they stood for will die with them.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Are you?
Then we stand together.
X- Men.
All of us.
We're in.
Let's go.
They're ready.
Yeah, I know.
But are you ready to do what you need to do when the time comes?
Dad, what's going on?
It's an earthquake.
We're trapped.
Charles always wanted to build bridges.
My God.
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!
The boy's in the southeast corner of the building.
Well, then.
Let's take it down!
In chess, the pawns go first.
Humans and their guns.
Plastic. They've learned.
That's why the pawns go first.
Target the bridge.
Fire!
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.
Oh, my stars and garters.
Go into stealth mode.
What aboutjets? Tanks? - Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.
Where are our ground troops?
30 minutes away.
Then God help us.
They're coming for him.
Don't ever do that again.
You men cover the doors!
Everybody get together! And hold this line!
Traitors to their own cause.
Finish them!
Not yet.
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.
With pleasure.
Hold it!
He's going for the boy!
Not if I get there first.
Kitty!
Come on.
Grow those back.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.
Going somewhere?
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?
Yes, I am.
Girls.
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.
No. Don't hurt him.
Let go of me. I didn't do anything.
Calm down. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be OK.
I thought you were a diplomat.
As Churchill said, "There comes a time..." Oh, you get the point.
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.
No.
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.
This way.
Oh, my God. What's going on?
Your powers won't work with me.
Stay close, all right?
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.
Who's hiding, dickhead?
Don't. No.
Don't.
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.
Do we look like we need your help?
It's time to end this war.
Take cover.
Get out of the way.
Let's go, let's go.
Move.
Go! Go! Go!
We work as a team.
Best defense is a good offence.
Bobby, think you can take out your old friend?
Go ahead.
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.
Right.
You're in over your head, Bobby.
Maybe you should go back to school.
You never should have left.
This is it.
Hey.
Make it a strike.
You never learn, do you?
Actually, I do.
I'm One of them?
This is what they want for all of us.
It's over, Jean.
It's over.
No! Don't shoot!
No!
Everybody get out of there!
Bobby!
What have I done?
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.
Go.
Jean!
Jean!
I know you're still there!
You would die for them?
No, not for them.
For you.
For you.
Save me.
I love you.
You're back.
I'm sorry.
I had to.
This isn't what I wanted.
I know.
It's what I want.
Hey.
Good to see you, buddy.
With the thanks of a grateful nation I introduce our new ambassador to the United Nations, and the representative to the world for all United States citizens, human and mutant alike, Dr. Hank McCoy.
Way to go, fur ball.

Commissioner. we can't encourage false hope.
All of us have had to come to terms with life here on Alpha.
Hope is the key to morale.
We should maintain it.
we should exploit it ruthlessly.
in order to achieve what should be our sole objective- going home.
Commissioner.
our priorities are survival and the search for an alternative place to live.
A return to Earth is out of the question.
'Commander Koenig. sensors detect a powered object approaching Alpha 'at speed three-point-seven-two.
range four-nine-zero-three.' What kind of object?
Indications are that it is a manned space craft. Commander.
Kano. when do we have a visual?
Estimated a minute.
Radio contact?
None. sir.
Keep all frequencies open.
Alan. Put Eagles 1 and 2 on a path for immediate lift off.
I want to show every welcome.
And if they're hostile. sir?
You'll be the first to know.
Visual.
Data analysed and ready.
Let's have it.
unidentified powered object.
'Object will orbit Alpha position at coordinates nine-zero-seven-nine.' Still no contact?
None. sir.
Eagle 1?
Intercept space craft. Lift off.
Eagle 2. lift off.
Space craft flight unstable.
They're in trouble.
They're not going into orbit.
Distress signals?
None.
Follow it.
It's gonna crash.
Stand clear. Eagles 1 and 2.
Paul. order a crash unit to Launch Pad Three immediately.
Call Carter. I want him to fly it.
Yes. sir.
Tell Professor Bergman to meet us there.
Kano. any readings of life signs?
Negative. Commander.
Paul. get security to join us.
Dr Russell. I'd like you to come.
Koenig. I think I'd better come too.
Commissioner. I need a doctor and a scientist there. not a politician.
Carter here. we'll be lifting off in five seconds.
All set?
I can't believe it's just chance.
No. they picked us out. John.
A deliberate landing on Alpha. They must know what they're looking for.
I wish we knew.
Looks like some kind of a hatch on the port side. Commander.
I'll put her down.
see if I can get a connection.
Confirm complete contact. sir.
Vacuum chamber is ready for entry.
I'm returning Eagle to standby.
Launch Pad One.
Victor?
Any signs of life?
The atomic structure of the metal is very dense.
But. ah certainly no movement I can see.
Kano. can you get us the spectro X analysis?
Spectro X. Commander.
'Internal atmosphere zero.
lunar gravity.' Helena. decompress.
Victor.
Looks like a central locking point.
That's it. Stand back.
Suspended animation?
Could be.
All right. we've got to start somewhere.
Tony. go back to the ship.
bring back some lights and Dr Russell's equipment.
Paul. activate gravity control and atmosphere.
You have gravity and atmosphere.
Commander.
I hope they know what they're doing.
None of us knows for sure.
Commissioner.
Koenig could be in danger.
why is there no visual linkup?
Hold on. we're all breaking our necks for a look.
Visual coming up now. Commissioner.
EKG and EEG both negative.
'There's absolutely no indication of life.' 'If it was suspended animation.
maybe the crash killed them.' 
no brain activity?' None as far as I can tell from radio microanalysis- the skin tissue shows no evidence of cell growth.
Who were they?
Where did they come from?
We can't learn any more without breaking this seal.
We've taken every possible precaution.
There's nothing else we can do.
Right. let's do it.
Stand by for biochemical analysis.
Main Mission standing by.
All our instruments indicated that life no longer existed.
Yes. we were convinced of it.
Only then did we break the seal.
Come on. come on.
what the hell's the delay?
Maybe they don't live by lunar time.
Commissioner.
Paul. have the crash unit stand by.
'They're going to fly the spaceship in on half power.' 
Maintenance crew prepare to receive alien spaceship.
Security. stand by travel tube to alien spaceship and prepare for visitors.
Excuse me.
Well. Koenig?
I think you should introduce us.
Captain Zantor.
Commissioner Simmonds.
Your status. please.
I represent Earth authority here on Moonbase Alpha and in that capacity.
may I say. welcome.
You represent Earth authority?
Yes.
And may I first assure you that those responsible for the regrettable loss of your crew member will be brought to account.
Commissioner. I take responsibility.
Yes. you must.
as operational commander.
We realise that the mistake which destroyed our comrade was from ignorance. not malice.
We do not require judicial revenge.
Captain. as soon as you've refreshed yourselves.
I suggest we meet to discuss our situation.
Dr Russell will see you to your quarters.
Be careful. Koenig.
They may not be as friendly as they seem.
Please accept these gifts as peace tokens from the people of Kaldor.
The libra bird was our symbol of peace and freedom.
But. like everything else on our planet. it ultimately became sterile.
When we left.
there were only two surviving pairs.
And their eggs.
when filled with gold.
were greatly prized as memorials to our fading life.
Thank you. Captain.
We accept your gifts.
May I ask how long you've been travelling?
Approximately three and a half of your centuries.
Our planet was dying.
Our people sent out many ships.
One to each planet we believed could sustain our kind of life.
And your ship was programmed to land on this moon?
Only to orbit this moon.
Then we would reanimate and prepare for the final stage of our journey.
to your planet. Earth.
You know our moon's not in Earth's orbit?
Yes. I fear that random variations in your trajectory and velocity caused our computer to err.
And so we have crashed.
It's remarkable your computer has found us at all.
It was so programmed.
How could it do otherwise?
Is your computer capable of calculating the present position of Earth?
Yes.
And it's programmed to reach Earth?
That is our prime directive.
It should be ours. too.
Unfortunately...some of us seem to have lost the will to achieve it.
So your hope is to settle on Earth?
If we are welcome. yes.
But if you are not?
Then we would submit ourselves to voluntary reduction.
In your terms.
we would take our own lives.
May I suggest that I run some tests to determine if you and our people on Earth are medically compatible?
I'll help to assess the damage to your ship.
I'll leave you in their hands.
We are grateful.
My pleasure. Captain.
A symbol of peace and freedom.
Perhaps the impossible doesn't take as long as we thought.
Their ship is bound for Earth.
Their computer is programmed for going home. He just said so.
What are you suggesting?
Oh. come on. None of you thought we had a chance. this is it.
All we need is the courage.
the vision and the leadership to seize their ship.
And the Kaldorians?
Expendable.
Cryogenic deep freezing we found to be inadequate for suspended animation.
The deterioration of the body can be slowed down.
but life itself cannot be suspended in that way.
On Earth. you freeze food to keep it fresh. do you not?
Yes. we do here.
But the flavour fades.
The problem's the same all over the universe.
Exactly. The flavour of life itself is lost.
But our process is different.
We have found a way of accelerating energy to create a cycle which holds all the cell particles in stasis.
There is no reason why that process should not be adapted to human use.
I find you sufficiently human.
Captain Zantor.
Then you will recommend we continue our journey to Earth?
Yes.
Your beauty would be greatly enhanced by suspended animation. Doctor.
Thank you.
To be perfectly at peace for seventy-five years.
That is the calculated time it will take us to reach Earth.
Seventy-five years?
The time will pass like a dream- in an instant.
Commander. with your approval we wish to continue our journey.
In order to do that we must repair the ship and leave within 20 of your lunar hours.
It is impossible to reprogram the computer from its directive.
Dr Russell?
They're medically clear.
Should you decide that we can go.
there will of course be a vacant space on our ship.
So one of us can go home?
The similarities between us are greater than the differences.
There is no reason why we should not suspend animation for one of you.
Thank you. Captain.
it's a most generous offer.
Check out the process thoroughly and let me know.
Koenig Captain Zantor. will you help us set up the experiment?
I know. but if it'll work for one it'll work for others.
Now seize their ship and six of us can home.
Shut up. Given any thought to what Earth will be like in 2074?
Whatever it's like. it's still our home. Our natural home.
Simmonds. if that suspended animation process works.
the computer will make an unbiased choice of one passenger from Alpha.
You'll be eligible like all the others.
Including yourself. of course.
No.
Look. I ought to be the one to go.
I have no place here on Alpha.
no function.
Believe me. if I could rig that computer it would shout out your name.
But you take your chance like the rest.
Kano.
I want Computer to select one person from Alpha to return to Earth.
The answer is to be confidential.
It'll take some time. Commander.
'John. serious emergency.
The spaceship. immediately.' There was every reason to believe it would work.
Both computers confirmed it.
Damn the computers!
She is not dead. Commander.
Her life cycle is suspended in time.
If you're so clever with life and death. bring her out of it.
We're ready to try again.
Do you know what you're doing?
Captain Zantor is in charge.
It's not working.
Commander.
I had Kano run the Kaldorian data through the computer.
What data?
The relative position of Earth.
It's that a way.
Seventy-five years.
What's that in miles?
Well. the computer passed that one up. It's busy with other problems.
How are they doing?
The ship will be ready on schedule.
Commander.
What's happening inside?
Thank you.
Attention Commander Koenig.
'Commander. could you return to the spaceship? We need your advice.' Dr Russell is in a deeper sleep than is right for the human metabolism.
Our mistake was to accept your computer's profile of her.
Our mistake was to allow her to try the experiment at all.
We overestimated your computer's ability to analyse the human spirit.
It does not seem to have understood it.
Does your computer understand it?
Oh yes.
But in reanimating from so deep a sleep.
there is a danger of cell damage to the brain.
The alternative is...death.
Captain.
John. we must trust him.
Commander?
Go ahead. Captain.
Well. Captain?
Paul.
The spaceship will be ready at 0900 hours.
So. one of us is going home.
Looks that way.
I have Computer's choice for the return to Earth.
Well. I see you all want to go home.
I asked Computer to choose one name.
It's given me three. A classic case of computer buck-passing.
Yes... Supposing you just read the list.
No. I'm not decoding this until Dr Russell convinces me the process is absolutely safe for us.
Well. I don't mind giving it a whirl.
Alan. even if it works it won't be a picnic.
Seventy-five years is a long time.
Yeah. Keep talking. granddad.
Alan. we're not even sure the Earth still exists.
Even if it does our families those we've loved won't be there any more.
Eight fifty-five. Paul.
Five minutes to go.
Have Captain Zantor come to see me.
Very good. sir. On his way.
You're supposed to be Commander.
You shouldn't have left that choice to a machine.
The choice must be an objective one.
The choice is obvious.
As Commissioner I'm not part of your team of experts.
My work is on Earth.
One word from you and I can be on that spaceship.
I'll promise you only this.
If the computer chooses you.
you go with my blessings.
And if it doesn't?
Then you wave goodbye with the rest of us.
No. I've been a politician all my life.
I don't believe in chance.
Well... Welcome back to the land of the living.
There remains only one question to be decided. Commander.
Who is going to accompany us to Earth?
Helena.
are you totally convinced it's safe?
We're beginning to understand it.
The process works if the Captain's computer has a matrix of its human subject.
But if someone other than Dr Russell were to go?
Then we shall have to make a matrix of the individual you choose.
Goodbye.
Commander.
Kano.
I want Computer to make the final choice.
One name.
Paul.
Commander?
Begin the countdown.
Victor. if Computer chooses you.
will you go?
I don't know.
Maybe I've had enough of Earth and its so called civilisation.
What about you. Helena?
I don't know.
It is a nice idea.
Kano! Simmonds has my comlock.
Now. you're going to do exactly as I tell you.
Simmonds went to the Maintenance Section and he's just entered the Power Station.
Deactivate that comlock and have Computer program another one for me.
Explain to the computer as best you can.
Sandra. put me through to the Power Station.
Simmonds. we have you on visual.
'You can come out peaceably or we'll come and get you. Your choice.' 
Get Security to seal off the Power Station. But no one moves in.
Sir.
Sandra. let's see what he's up to.
'Switch it off.
And the other.
Simmonds!
It's too late for talk.
Simmonds. you're trapped.
'Really? I know precisely what I'm doing.' Open up.
Sandra. let's see that close up.
Switch to reserve power.
Stabilise that back-up power.
Trying to. sir.
Now. listen to me. Koenig.
This is my hostage.
Those men are just stunned.
Now don't make me kill anyone.
No one on Alpha will live for thirty minutes without this unit in place.
Stabilise that power. Paul.
Now. I go on that ship or Moonbase Alpha freezes over.
It's up to you.
What do you say now?
Commander.
countdown is T minus 28 minutes.
Do I continue counting?
Continue.
Simmonds. put back that unit.
Computer hasn't chosen yet.
Oh yes. I know my chances. Koenig!
Now this way. I go for sure.
It's my decision.
You can't make that decision.
I got to be Commissioner by doing what's necessary. not what's right.
Now. you have 15 minutes to persuade your alien friends or freeze.
Damn it.
Hold the countdown.
Get Captain Zantor here.
Captain Zantor to Main Mission.
If there's one man Alpha could do without. it's Simmonds.
I say let him go.
Any decision we make must involve Zantor.
We can't. We can't let Simmonds jump the computer.
Moonbase systems are running down.
Commander. We must decide soon.
OK. So let Simmonds think he's going.
Commander.
We can take him on his way to the ship. Especially if Zantor knows.
We can't play games with that converter.
It's wrong. John.
but you've got to let him go.
Captain.
Commissioner Simmonds insists on returning to Earth with you.
Unless we agree. he'll destroy Alpha.
Is he capable of carrying out this threat?
He is.
Then you must accept his terms.
I agree.
It's blackmail.
Let him go. Commander.
We'll be well rid of him.
Simmonds.
Koenig. Your decision?
We agree.
Give Simmonds restricted access from the Power Station to the spaceship.
Guarantees. Koenig.
My word.
Not enough.
Commissioner.
you need our cooperation.
I will be your hostage.
I accept.
Captain. Here you are. Simmonds.
You'll need this.
Thank you. Captain.
I understand your position.
The Commissioner is...diseased.
It is a tragedy that he should succeed through the use of force.
My thanks. Commander.
Professor.
You may now take your travel position. Commissioner.
The rest is automatic.
You first.
Hello. Earth.
Hello. Earth.
This is Commissioner Simmonds.
returning home.
After seventy-five years.
'Earth Control. do you hear me?
'Come in. Earth. Hello Earth?
'Earth?
'Earth. can you read me?
Hello Earth?
Commander.
Yes. Paul?
'I'm getting a signal. sir.
from the Kaldorian spaceship.' What kind of signal?
'From Commissioner Simmonds.
He thinks he's approaching Earth.
can you hear me?
'Earth?
'Hello. Earth?
'This is Commissioner Simmonds.
Can you hear me?' Zantor knew. He must have known.
No. no.
Evidently Simmonds didn't give him a chance to make a matrix.
Hello. Earth? Earth?
Earth. can you hear me?
What's the matter with everybody?
It hasn't worked.
It hasn't worked!
Koenig?
Koenig. can you hear me? Koenig!
'You've got to help me!
This hasn't worked!
'You've got to help me.
Send someone to get me. Koenig.
Koenig. help me!
There's nothing we can do.
Can you hear me? Koenig!
Koenig!
Zantor! ZANTOR! ZANTOR!
For God's sake! ZANTOR.
Help me. someone.
Come.
At last!
Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
Mama!
Éothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few. So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at Its base which is little more than a drain.
How? How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look. There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an Image of the splendor of the kings of Men In glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer Is falling.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen It.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find Its way back Into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by Its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving Its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves Is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to Its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
How many?
Some thousands. More come every day.
Who's covering the river to the north?
We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies? Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How? When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me. Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool So juicy sweet Our only wish To catch a fish So juicy sweet Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master. Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me. Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol. That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No! No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No. Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No. No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go. Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please. It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he? Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
All Isengard is emptied.
How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose: To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
Gondor will answer.
Gondor?!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions There is no time. War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech. Oak.
Chestnut. Ash.
Good. Good. Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back! Move to the caves!
Keep moving.
Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
Most have seen too many winters.
Or too few.
Look at them. They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills Into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move! Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
Open the gate!
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
What's happening out there?
Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
Fire!
Fire!
Send them to me! Come on!
Good!
Swords! Swords!
Legolas! Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own.
War? Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen! Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them! Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?!
You must help. Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate. Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
Hold them!
How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on. We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
What?
I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
Throw another one over here!
Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached. Retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait! Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
Turn around. Take us south.
South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes. Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad? We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here. Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
And barricade the entrance!
So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit. A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin! Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way It was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, It's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, It will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even If you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.  And they'll say, Yes! That's one of my favorite stories.  "Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?" "Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot." Well, you've left out one of the chief characters: Samwise the Brave.  I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
Samwise the Brave.  Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked. Tricksy. False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes. No! No!
It's too risky. It's too risky.
Where is he? Where has he gone?
Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes. She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.


at this juncture of my life to be quite boring. say Im one thing, but actually you're another thing.
I think being true to who you are is important.
I'm not saying you need to be psychoanalytical about the whole mess.
But don't be afraid.
Yeah, I but don't be afraid.
I had... I had lunch with Jimmy Baldwin the other day.
How is he?
He's a lovely man.
And he told me the plot of his new book.
And he said to me, "but I just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels." And I said, "Jimmy, "your novel's about a negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew.
Well, wouldn't you call that a problem?" And he... and he looked at and he laughed because he knew I was right.
I'm saying, you know, if you're gonna write something like that, at least be honest why you're writing it.
Can't we just be honest?
Well, I don't think you actually need to be honest.
But don't come asking some white man from the south whether your book about a black man fucking some Jew, when they're both of the same sex, is an issue!
Don't ask me that!
"Oh, no, it's not an issue, Jimmy.
Everyone's gonna be-be-be quite pleased with that topic." So how about you, Truman?
Do you admit it?
Well, Im not nearly that controversial.
I'm not! I'm not! I am not.
I'm not nearly that controversial.
Oh, come on.
Hi. It's Truman for William Shawn, please.
Have you read the, uh, the article about the killings in Kansas in the front section of the New York times?
Well, I think that's what I want to write about.
I... I want to go tonight.
I figured you'd missed it.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
I thought I was heading to Kansas by myself.
God, Im glad you agreed to come.
You're the only one I know with the qualifications to be both a research assistant and a personal bodyguard.
Thank you.
Now Im nervous.
Yes?
Mr. Truman Capote and miss Nelle Harper Lee?
That's us.
Where would you like these, sir?
You can put that right the between the doors.
What all did you bring?
Just a few things.
Thank you greatly, sir.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Um it's an honor to have you with us, sir, and I hope you won't mind me saying, but I thought your last book was even better than the first.
Thank you.
I mean, just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get.
Thank you very much.
Ma'am.
You're pathetic.
What?
You paid him to say that.
You paid him to say that.
How did you know?
"Just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get"?
I thought that was a good line.
Do you think that was too much?
Yeah, a little bit.
Your keys.
Thank you.
Sign here, please.
Alvin Dewey, Kansas bureau of investigation.
Hi. I'm looking for Alvin Dewey.
Hi.
Mr. Dewey.
Truman Capote, from the New Yorker.
Bergdorf's.
Sorry?
The scarf.
Oh. Nice.
Thank you.
Mr. Dewey, I wonder when we could arrange an interview, some time to talk.
Uh, about what?
Well, we're not looking for any inside information.
You know, I don't care one way or another if you catch whoever did this.
I'm writing an article on how the clutter killings are affecting the town.
You know, how you all are bearing up.
I care.
Excuse me?
I care.
I care a great deal if we catch whoever did this.
Oh, I see.
As do a lot of folks around here.
Oh, of course.
Do you have press credentials?
What's a New Yorker?
Magazine.
Magazines don't give out you can come to the news conference with the rest of them.
Sears, roebuck.
The boy was 16?
He was 15.
Uh, Nancy was 16.
And it's her friend that found them?
Uh, Laura Kinney.
Can you spell that?
Uh, I... I assume you're ok with the Laura part.
But, uh, please, leave her be.
There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans.
A whole bunch of Mexicans.
Hello, George.
It's good to see you again.
Uh, I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or "a whole bunch," as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos.
We're gonna find whoever did this.
Now, 4 good people from our community are dead.
So let's remember that.
The west Kansas farm committee is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
Please print that.
And thank you all for coming.
He was... he was foxy with that old man.
Hmm.
This make you miss Alabama?
Not even a little bit.
You lie.
I don't lie.
Good morning.
Hi.
Can any of you tell me where Id find Laura Kinney?
Is that her? With the boy?
Yeah, with Danny burke.
Danny burke?
Laura?
Thank you.
Truman.
I'm gonna find out where that girl lives.
Can I do that alone?
All right?
Ok.
I think I scared a friend of yours this morning.
She came looking for you when I was writing.
You hate my friends.
No, I wouldn't say "hate." Just as long as they don't knock on my door.
I saw the bodies today.
Which?
The clutters.
I... I looked inside the coffins.
That's horrifying.
It comforts me.
Something so horrifying it's, uh, it's a relief.
Normal life falls away.
But then, I was never much for normal life.
No.
Yeah, people here won't talk to me.
They, uh, hmm, they want someone like you, like, uh, like Nelle.
Me, they hate.
I can't think of a single quality I share with Nelle.
Weli maybe manliness.
Good morning, Henry.
Good morning, sir.
Let's go.
Bye.
Hi, Danny. I'm Harper Lee.
Nancy was your best friend?
Yeah, she was my best friend.
How has Danny been?
Pretty shattered.
Nothing terrible has ever happened to him before.
Danny was the last one at the house that night.
That's why Mr. Dewey keeps interviewing him.
They don't think that he had anything to do with it.
It's just to see if he remembers anything unusual.
People in town do seem to wonder if he was involved.
Yeah. That's been really hard for Danny.
Oh, it's the hardest when someone has a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise.
Ever since I was a child, folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way I the way I am.
You know, the way I talk.
And they're always wrong.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I wanna show you something.
Maybe this will give you, um, a better picture of what happened.
Oh what is this?
It's your diary.
"Danny here tonight and we watched TV.
"So nice just having him sit with us.
"Left at 11:00.
P.s. He's the only one I really love." And that was that.
Did Laura say "shattered"?
Uh, "pretty shattered.
Nothing terrible has ever happened to him before." You know I have 94% recall of all conversations?
I've tested myself.
Hmm.
Weli how did that happen?
Apparently detective Foxy's wife, uh, has read fiction.
That's great.
We're in.
We are in.
In.
You came.
Hi.
Thank you for having us.
Thank you.
Get yourselves in here.
Alvin, get your pants on.
They're here.
Hey, little Deweys.
Hi.
Hi.
Shake it with your wrist.
Use your whole arm.
More.
You think Im kidding around, but Im serious.
Mama would've put in half the bottle.
She had to buy it by the crate.
Alvin's gonna hate this.
I have to stop.
Oh, I cannot believe you're from New Orleans.
I miss it so much.
Well, I only lived there for a short while, but my mama was born and bred.
You know something?
Alvin pretends he doesn't know who you are, but the minute you came to town, he read your books.
No!
He had one of his men pick up breakfast at tiffany's in Kansas city 'cause it's banned in the library here.
And he said, "I feel like you're spiting me." I said... I said, "do you think I took this job to spite you?" I was writing the script as they were filming, all that time in Italy and Id work like mad all day long and then dash down to the ba around midnight to hand in the next day's scenes.
And Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar Humphrey Bogart. where he and john john Huston. had, uh they drank every night.
And I mean drank, you know, like famished water buffaloes.
Weli Id only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me I had a phone call.
And it was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died.
I... I flew home to New York, terribly distraught but when I got to the apartment, I could see that Joe was in even worse shape than I was.
He grabbed my hand and he said to me, "talk.
Talk about anything.
"You know?
"I mean, any subject in the world.
"Don't worry whether it'll interest me or not.
"Just talk so I won't break down." He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts.
It was too painful.
It's been a hard couple of weeks for Alvin.
He and herb clutter were good friends from church.
Oh, Marie.
Oh, come on, Alvin.
These are good people.
Why would they put a pillow under the boy's head just to shoot him?
Why would they tuck Nancy in?
So many of my friends would love to meet you.
Oh, that'd be fine.
You don't have to worry, 'cause Im not going to write about this till everything's over.
Well, Im not worried.
I know what room you're in at the hotel, and I know where you live in Brooklyn.
oh, god.
You're celebrating.
Uh, well, remember Nelle's manuscript she sent me in New York?
Yeah. Mockingbird.
Killing a mockingbird.
You said it was good.
And I was right.
She just heard Lippincott wants to publish it.
Well, Jesus.
Jesus, well, that's... that's terrific.
Tell her congratulations from me.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Jealous.
Will you be home by Christmas?
I... I wanna come home.
I wanna come home.
I do. I just thought if they catch whoever did this, who knows what?
I'll probably be here till next Christmas.
I'm gonna let you go.
I... I, uh no, don't go. Um, we'll go away next spring to write.
Maybe Spain.
Yeah.
Ok, Im gonna let you go.
Jack Jack, I promise.
Mm-hmm.
We'll go away this spring to write.
Maybe Spain.
Ok.
All right.
My wife worked there, too.
What did she do in the house?
Cleaning.
Cooking a little bit.
Quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.
"Girdle up. No extra bulges.
"If you're dressed right, when he gets home, "the rest of the evening should be smooth sailing.
Bon voyage, gals." I can't believe you got that whole page.
I only read it once.
I've tested my tested myself.
I have 94% percent recall.
Cut that out.
Cut that out.
Cut that Cut cut that out.
Isn't that something, Alvin?
Oh, it's impressive.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. He's upset.
What's he upset about?
They know who did it.
2 men.
You know, they passed through Kansas city last week writing bad checks.
By the time Alvin's boys got up there, they were gone.
Skipped out.
Oh!
Yeah. They... they don't know where.
No idea.
One of them had a cellmate who gave him up for the $1,000 reward.
Do they know the name of the cellmate?
No. No, I don't know.
Alvin knows.
I guess this isn't the appropriate time to go ask him.
He's beside himself.
Hello?
Alvin, get in here.
Dad, it's the telephone.
Not now, Alvin.
God damn it.
Get over here.
Dad!
Alvin, not now.
Sit.
Dad? Dad?
You need to call the chief of police in Las Vegas.
Alvin, what'd you say?
He said you need to call them immediately.
Truman Capote.
Dorothy Sanderson.
I figured you'd be left alone this morning by that hardworking husband of yours, so I have breakfast, and I have news, and I have literature.
My friend, Jack, mailed me that book you wanted and I inscribed it myself.
"To the maiden of the midwest, the priestess of the plains, the queen of the kitchen, my first novel. Truman." You're too much. Come on in.
Oh, thank you.
Go into the living room.
Have a seat.
Let me get that.
It's been ringing all morning.
Hello?
Truman, I meant in here.
That's the women's cell.
It's hardly ever used, but they wanted them separate.
Let's sit in the living room.
They put you in the women's cell.
Do you have any aspirin?
My legs.
Truman?
Please.
I'm sorry.
In the matter of the state of Kansas.
Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith, this court has been informed by counsel, Mr. Weeks, that the defendants wish to waive their right to a preliminary hearing.
His mind is somewhere else.
Mr. Hickock, is that your wish?
Yes, sir.
Why are they doing that?
Mr. Smith.
I... I ask that the waiver be effectuated.
"Effectuated"?
So noted.
Remove the prisoners.
Was it your choice to waive the hearing?
Do you still need some?
Give me your hand.
I could kill you if you got too close.
Now, would you like some water, or Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book.
He said we'd curry favor with the judge if we waived our rights.
Who did?
The lawyer.
Your picture's undignified.
People recall first impressions.
Oh, what's been your first impression?
Hello.
Mr. Shawn.
Truman.
I'm writing a book.
It... it's too much for a single article.
This town, the the killers most of all.
Uh, you will be stunned by Perry Smith.
Why, what's happening?
Well, not much yet, but I know.
I... I can sense him.
He... he's desperately lonely, uh, frightened.
I have a question.
Are you ready?
Would it matter?
Uh, no.
How much more money can you send me?
And... and how quickly could you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures?
Who are you smiling at right now?
I'm smilin' at you.
You know, Dick's a very famous fashion photographer.
World-famous.
Am I gonna be in a fashion magazine?
So there's no worry of having a bad picture.
Who were you closer to, your mom or your dad?
What's that?
Who were you closer to, your mom or your dad?
Well, both.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Have you talked to them?
Yeah.
Who'd you talk to first?
Perry, honey, you look terrific, baby.
That was good.
Can you show us the tattoo on your chest then?
Yeah.
Where did Perry get the art set?
Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
Yes, sir.
Defendants, rise.
Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene Hickock, you stand accused of 4 counts of the crime of murder in the first degree.
Have you reached a unanimous verdict?
We have, your honor.
What is your verdict?
Guilty on all 4 counts.
Have you unanimously reached a sentence?
We have, your honor.
What is the sentence?
Death.
I need to see him before we go.
Perry.
They're going to transfer you up to lansing today.
And you'll have to make sure to put me on the visitors list.
Otherwise I can't see you.
I'm going to help find you a proper lawyer.
You need a serious lawyer for an appeal.
Now they took Dick last night.
And I need you to get him to do the same thing and just put me on the visitors list.
And I thought, where does the family eat?
You know?
I mean, does he, like, reach his hand through the bars and have dinner with everyone around the table?
Nelle, kudos on, um kill the bird, is it?
That's... that's close.
Thank you.
That's marvelous.
Who's your publisher?
Lippincott.
Yes. It's a children's book right?
Yes.
No, no. It's it's about children.
Yes.
Yes, Ive heard a lot about it.
Good.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I didn't even know she wrote.
He's sad and he's shy.
And he's terrified.
They shotgunned the entire family in the face.
And I thought, at first, "mmm, Im gonna be scared of these men.
I'm gonna run, run, run right home." Actually, the brother in the family Kenyon is his name, they had placed a pillow under his head, and then shot him point-blank in the face.
Almost as if they were putting him to sleep and then shot him.
This is the start of a great love affair.
Yeah. Truman in love with Truman.
The book Im writing will return him to the realm of humanity.
It's the book I was always meant to write.
Well, he hasn't actually written a word of it yet, but he says it's the nonfiction book of the decade, so so what have you been doing?
And Ill tell you, I was in Marilyns apartment just last week, talking about movies, art.
Finally I had to break it to her that of the 4 matisses hanging on her wall, 2 were upside down.
Can I have another, please?
To answer your question, Im following breakfast at tiffany's by blazing a different path.
By inventing an entirely new kind of writing.
The nonfiction novel.
You have a subject?
Yes.
On the night of November 14, 2 men broke into a quiet farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family.
Now, why did they do that?
2 worlds exist in this country.
The quiet, conservative life, and the life of those 2 men.
The underbelly.
The criminally violent.
And those worlds converged that bloody night.
Now, I spent the past 3 months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence.
Now I spent hours talking to the killers and Ill spend more.
'Cause researching this work has changed my life.
You know, it's altered my point of view about almost everything.
Yeah.
And I think those who read it will be similarly affected.
So you find them a new lawyer.
Well, they're facing execution in 6 weeks.
You know, they need someone to argue whether or not that's right.
Ok.
And Id also like to see them alive.
Weli yeah.
Yeah, I need to hear their stories.
Well, just be careful what you do to get what you want.
Im finding them a lawyer.
Truman, you're finding yourself a lawyer.
No, Im finding them a lawyer.
There's a difference.
The Warden will see you now.
Well, we do all right by our boys.
Hmm.
Showers once a week.
Feed them good.
We'll be feeding Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if he don't eat.
Try and get the food in through his arm.
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?
Well, he hasn't eaten in a month.
It ain't his right to kill himself.
It's the right of the people.
The people of this state.
And that's who I work for, the people.
No one told me.
Yeah, he won't eat.
Uh-huh.
When can I see him?
Well, let me see.
How about you coming 3:00, Thursday afternoon?
No.
Um that's no good.
I need to see them now.
Then... then whenever I want, for as long as I want.
Well, that's just not how we do things around here, Mr. Capote.
Yeah, I understand what a burden unlimited visitation might be on this institution and on the people who pay for it.
And I want to be clear that I don't expect the citizens of Leavenworth county to have to shoulder that burden.
This is to be dispensed as you see fit.
You know, I didn't know where to count your boy at first, him being half-Indian.
But I did him a favor.
I counted him as a white man.
Uh-huh. You're a kind and generous man.
Spread your feet.
This way.
Hey, hey.
Yeah, hello.
Hey, thanks a lot for your help with the lawyer.
Oh, that's fine.
Wow, you must be really desperate for a story to come all the way out here.
You want to go see Perry, go ahead.
Thank you.
You want my advice, though, Mr. Capote, he's just trying to prove the insanity defense.
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's Truman.
It's your friend.
It's ok.
This is before she had us.
Before she started drinking.
Who took care of you as a child?
Orphanage.
Me and Linda.
And that's your sister?
You know, we're not so different as you might think.
Yeah, I was abandoned repeatedly as a child.
My mama would drag me along to some new town, so she could take up with another man she'd met.
Night after night, she'd lock me in the hotel room alone.
Mama would turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what.
And I was terrified.
And Id scream my head off until finally Id collapse on the carpet next to the door and Id fall asleep.
Then after years of this, she just left me with relatives in Alabama.
Who raised you up?
My aunts.
And that's where I met Nelle.
And she lived she lived next door.
Your mother was Indian?
Cherokee.
So drinking was not a good thing for her.
No tolerance for it.
We're on, uh, suicide watch.
That's why they leave the lights on at night.
I hope we're past that now.
I do.
Be careful of Ricardo.
I think he wants you all to himself.
All right.
But he's naturally mendacious.
Not to be trusted.
If he had $100, he'd steal a stick of chewing gum.
Perry, I want to take your notebooks with me.
I want to read them.
If I leave here without understanding you, the world will see you as a monster always.
I don't want that.
'Cause he trusts me.
I mean, that's why he gave it to me.
And he-he's given me absolutely everything.
And he wants so badly to be taken seriously to be held in some esteem.
Do you?
Do I what?
Do you hold him in esteem, Truman?
Well, he's a gold mine.
And he's told me his entire life.
His, uh, his dead mother.
Uh, he had a brother and a sister kill themselves.
Awful.
Did you tell him your mama did the same thing?
See, I can't tell him everything.
We've been talking our heads off for the past month.
And sometimes when I when I think how good my book can be, I can hardly breathe.
Anyway, th-this is this is what I wanted to read to you.
Uh, "if called upon to make a speech..." "if called upon to make a speech"?
I mean, this is exactly what Im talking about.
A speech, just in case he's ever recognized for an achievement.
"I can't remember what I was going to say for the life of me.
"I don't think ever before have so many people "been so directly responsible "for my being so very, very glad.
"It's a wonderful moment and a rare one.
Thank you!" There's... there's an exclamation point at the end of that "thank you" in case you didn't catch it.
Where'd you go?
I guess it stopped being funny.
I... I never said it was.
But, wait, listen to this.
I was 14.
One day I said to him, mom's dead.
I could see it.
A week later we got the news.
She finally drunk herself found her shivering she hit me so many times with that flashlight, she broke it.
That night, I I dreamed about that big yellow bird.
Clawed that nun's eyes, bright like the sun.
Lifted me to the sky.
Sometimes you see a thing how it really is.
Well, you're nothing if not hardworking.
Hey, you look good.
Healthy again.
You know, Ive decided on a title for my book.
I think you'll like it.
It's very masculine.
In cold blood.
Isn't that good?
And that refers to the crime or the fact that you're still talking to the criminals?
Oh, the former, among other things.
I see.
I wanted to ask if you'd let me look at your investigation notes.
That lawyer you helped find for your friends got them a hearing at the Kansas supreme court yeah, I heard this morning. on the issue of inadequate counsel.
Alvin, I mean, do you not want me to look at your notes?
You are permitted to say no.
I'll tell you what.
If those boys get off, Im coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down.
I have to be in court at 9:00, but you call Roy Church and he'll show you what you want to see.
Thank you.
It's as much for me as for anyone.
I couldn't bear the thought of losing you so soon.
We're gonna be able to use your book for our case.
You... you'll write we never got to raise an insanity plea.
You wrote how terrible the lawyers was.
I... I haven't written a word yet.
What have you been doing?
Research. Talking to you.
All right.
I... I had hoped wh-what are you calling it?
The book?
I have no idea.
Perry, if Im going to write about you, if Im going to determine how to write about you, we need to talk about, you know, why you're here.
And, you know, the murders, and that night at the clutter house.
Do you worry what Ill think?
Is that it?
Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.
I know a lot of people.
Perry, I have invitations to be in morocco, Greece, and I prefer to be here with you.
Jack, be patient with me.
I'm just missing this one piece.
Well, how long is that gonna take?
Why don't you just try leaving him alone for a while?
Come to Spain.
You can always visit him later.
I don't know.
Well, Im off.
I'm just... Ive got my own writing to do.
Well, do it in Brooklyn.
Wait for me.
There's too many people around. I've Ill leave the address on the kitchen table.
Well, think about what I said, and join me when you can.
I will.
I will.
Ok?
Bye.
Hi.
Truman.
We never intended on killing that family.
Capote, will you get that straight in your book, please?
No premeditation.
What are you doing?
I have to fly back east.
When?
An hour.
I miss you already.
Write me every 5 minutes.
Hey, you know, we never did intend on killing that family.
Capote?
Capote?
What?
Truman, Ive not been able to tear myself away from your book.
It's that good.
It's... it's not good, it's astonishing.
This first half is astonishing.
Oh, thank you.
When will you be done, do you think?
Yes, I... Im already well into the third part.
But I I can't finish that till I convince Perry to describe the night of the killings to me.
I was... I was planning to visit this fall, see?
Then I think you need to talk to him now.
And we all need to see how this ends for the final part.
I... I... I can't finish the book till I know what happens.
If Perry and Dick are executed, it's one thing.
And if not, weli Truman, you've got your ending.
I really don't know.
The Kansas court denied their appeal.
It came over the wire on Friday.
I mean, you need to talk to Perry now.
He'll be dead by September.
I mean, Im sorry.
I know how much you've come to care about him.
Right. Yes, right.
So I want to set up a reading for you in the fall, in New York, and, uh, well, we'll build some interest, and we'll publish in the fall.
Thank god.
There's nothing in the house.
Why aren't you working?
Well, I knew you couldn't be counted on to stock the kitchen.
What are we going to feed our famous guest?
Oh, Jesus, I completely forgot.
Plus, I, uh, finished my novel yesterday.
What?
When was the last time you wrote to him?
I don't know.
What's this?
It's a letter for Truman I was asked to deliver.
It's from Perry.
Let's have it.
"Dear friend Truman, where are you?
"Read this item in a medical dictionary.
'Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia, 'by fracture of the cervical vertebrae, 'by laceration of the trachea.' "Not too comforting, as we lost our appeal.
"Missing you.
"Alone and desirous of your presence.
Your amigo, Perry." Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday.
I was wondering why you were in such a good mood.
That's a terrible thing to say.
I... I write him all the time Ive just Ive been so focused on- on the book lately.
So Jack thinks Im using Perry, but he also thinks I fell in love with him when I was in Kansas.
Now, how both of those things can be true is beyond me.
Thank you.
Well, did you?
Did you fall in love with him?
I don't know how to answer that.
Truman.
It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house, and one day he stood up and went out the back door while I went out the front.
Are you kidding me?
No.
Listen, you be nice to Jack.
Sometimes I think he's what I like about you best.
I'll see you at the reading in New York.
16th.
16th.
Adios.
What was he in jail for?
Well, they said it was for not paying his taxes, but really, for being an outsider.
Refusing to go along.
Lowell, you're being moved.
Why?
You're going to final holding.
No.
Come on, Lowell.
Open the door.
Stand up.
Put your arms behind your back.
Ok, last chance.
Well, get up.
Ah!
Turn around.
Put your arms behind your back.
Now Dick and me, we're next in line.
I'm so sorry Ive been away.
It was a long time.
I know.
How's the book coming along?
Oh, very slowly.
Will you show it to me?
I've hardly written anything.
Good evening, New Yorkers, and thank you for coming to the first public reading, the first offering of any kind, of Truman Capote's new work, in cold blood.
Hello.
My name is Truman Capote.
For this for this evening's program, Im going to read, uh, some passages from the first 3 parts of my new book.
"The village of Holcomb "stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas, "a lonesome area that other Kansans call 'out there.' "Until one morning in mid-November, 1959, "few Americans, in fact, few Kansans, had ever heard of Holcomb.
"Like the waters of the Arkansas river, "like the motorists on the highway, "exceptional happenings never stopped there.
"Perry Smith's voice was both gentle and prim.
"A voice that, though soft, "manufactured each sound exactly, "ejected it like a smoke ring issuing from a parson's mouth.
"The 4 coffins, which quite filled the small, flower-crowded parlor "were to be sealed at the funeral services, "very understandably, "for the effect was disquieting.
"Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red velvet, "her brother a bright plaid shirt.
"The parents were more sedately attired, "Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe.
"And it was this especially that lent the scene an awful aura, "the head of each was completely encased in cotton.
"A swollen cocoon "twice the size of an ordinary blown-up balloon.
"And the cotton, "because it had been sprayed with a glossy substance, "twinkled like Christmas tree snow.
"One Tuesday at dawn, a carload of strangers, "ignorant of the local disaster, "were startled by what they saw as they crossed the prairies "and passed through Holcomb.
"Windows ablaze.
"Almost every window in almost every house, "and in the brightly-lit rooms, fully-clothed people, "even entire families, "who had sat the whole night wide awake watchful, listening.
"Of what were they frightened?
It might happen again." Thank you.
And I slipped and I ripped a hole from the bottom of my scrotum All the way up to the top of the crack of my ass.
And I sat there.
And I didn't know it.
All I felt was a I... I didn't know it.
All I felt was a cool breeze you know, between my Sorry. If I may, uh yes.
Your portrait of those men was terrifying.
Terrifying.
Thank you.
Stop that man!
Come back here!
Dad!
Have any of you met my father?
He hasn't spanked me in years.
George didn't come backstage.
He had... he had a something that his wife had to rush him off to.
But he made a point of yeah, well, Im still wal Im still waiting for a call.
It was beautiful.
And everybody came.
Hmm. Tennessee everybody came.
Tennessee loved it.
Of course he loved it.
Should we do more?
No, we... we just sit and wait while people talk about it and we let them do the work.
I mean, this... this book is going to change everything.
It's gonna change how people see your writing.
I think it's going to Chan how people write.
Are you gonna be finished by October?
I think so.
You know, they're scheduled for next month.
To hang.
Yeah.
We're gonna commit as many issues as it takes to publish.
Whatever it takes.
Well, Im going to Kansas tomorrow, and and Ill get Perry to talk.
What's he got to lose?
Sorry, but hey, this may sound strange to you, but Im going to miss him.
You'll be able to finish now.
Need to check your papers, sir.
This is what we've been waiting for.
A stay of execution to make a federal appeal.
All thanks to you.
Thank you!
They're not gonna corner me now.
Not unless the U.S.
Government says so.
Kansas has had it in for me for 10 years.
They can't corner me now.
Mmm-mmm.
Hey, Perry, sit down for a minute.
I... I need you to talk to me.
We've got all the time in the world to talk.
I've been thinking about Ricardo.
You really need to stop sending him those trashy books.
I won't even mention the pornography.
Now, I realize that Dick probably can't grasp the literature that you gave me.
Uh, the books you send him only they only exacerbate the problem.
They only heighten or intensify it.
Maybe we can get him started on a program.
Perry, I know what "exacerbate" means.
Ok, well, just thinking there... there's not a word or a sentence or a concept that you can illuminate for me.
There is one singular reas I keep coming here.
Truman.
November 14, 1959.
3 years ago. 3 years.
Hmm?
And that's... that's all I want to hear from you.
Now I asked you not to. Ever.
This is absurd.
Do you know what absurd means?
I'm ready.
I have a plane to catch.
I found your sister in Tacoma.
Maybe she'll talk to me about something useful.
Please don't go out there.
Hey, this is my work, Perry.
I'm working.
And when you want to tell what I need to hear, you let me know.
June's dead.
Frank shot himself.
Now Perry did what he did.
I used to love him.
He was my little doll.
He scares me now.
When was the last time you saw him?
10 years ago.
10 years.
Could I borrow one of these pictures?
Take the whole thing.
I don't want them anymore.
Don't be taken in by my brother.
He's got this sensitive side he'll show.
You believe he's gentle and so easily hurt, but he'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand.
I believe that.
Hello, handsome.
What's the name of your book?
What's the name of your book?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Truman Capote read last night before a packed audience "from his nonfiction book in cold blood.
"The true-crime novel tells of killers Richard Hickock "and Perry Smith, who brutally murdered a Kansas family 3 years ago." Wait, who sent that to you?
That's not your goddamn business.
It is my business, because it's not true.
The organizers of the reading needed a title.
They picked one, a sensational one, I admit, to attract a crowd.
They picked it?
Yes.
It's not your title.
Perry, I haven't chosen one yet.
How could I choose a title when we still haven't talked about that night?
How could I?
I couldn't possibly.
You pretend to be my friend.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.
And I couldn't pretend to be your friend 'cause the truth is, I can't help wanting to be.
You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to.
I have something from your sister.
She misses you.
Look at my belly.
There must be something wrong with us, to do what we did.
We heard there was $10,000 in that house.
Once we tied up everybody and searched all over, I knew the guy that told us about it was was wrong. There was there was no money.
Dick wouldn't believe it so he went tearing through the house, banging on the walls looking for a safe.
When he was done, he said he was gonna go up to Nancy's room and have his way with her.
I wouldn't allow it.
And I told him that.
So I sat with her.
Dick came up and got me.
We turned off the lights and went down to the basement where Mr. Clutter and the boy was.
He kept saying, "no witnesses," but I I figured if I waited him out, he'd he'd give up and we'd leave them tied up there.
And we'd drive all night.
They'd never find us.
We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists to a pipe over his head.
And he... he looked hurt, so I cut him down.
I... I put a box out there so he'd be more comfortable.
He asked how his wife and daughter was and I... I said they were fine, and they were getting ready for sleep, and it wouldn't be long tili till morning when they'd find him.
He was just looking at me.
Looking into my eyes.
Like he expected me to kill him.
Like he expected me to be the kind of person who would kill him.
I was thinking, "this... this nice man is scared of me." I was so ashamed.
I mean, I thought he was a... a very nice gentle man.
And I thought so right up till I slit his throat.
I didn't know what I did till I heard the sound.
Added up, how much money did you get from the clutters that night?
Between $40 and $50.
I mean, the truth is, Im desperate to be done with it.
I've spent 4 years of my life on this book.
They got a stay of executive yesterday.
Another, yes.
Supreme court.
It's harrowing.
Me, all I want to do is to write the ending and there's no end in sight.
No, thank you.
"Dear friend Truman, "haven't heard from you in such a long while.
"Please help find new lawyer.
"If not, Dick will have to write "the supreme court brief himself.
"Our last appeal.
"What a pair of wretched creatures.
"Please help.
Your amigo? Perry." Just put it with the others.
You know, at least for Nelle you should you should try and pretend you're having a good time tonight.
I thought Id find you here.
Oh, Nelle.
Nelle.
Thank you.
I'll have another, please.
How are you?
Terrible.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean, it's torture the way what they're doing to me.
And now it's the supreme court.
And can you believe it?
If they win this appeal, I wili have a complete nervous breakdown.
I may never recover, and Ill just pray that it turns my way.
It must be difficult.
Oh, it's torture.
They're torturing me.
I see.
And how'd you like the movie, Truman?
Yeah I frankly don't see what all the fuss is about.
Hello.
Mr. Truman Capote?
Yeah.
I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith in the Kansas correctional system.
Will you accept charges?
Yes.
Mr. Smith, you're on the line.
Hello.
Hello?
Hello, Perry.
They let me make a couple of phone calls before I go down to holding.
Y-y-you heard the supreme court rejected the appeal?
No, I... I didn't.
I hadn't heard that.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. They let me make 2 phone calls.
We got a date set for the warehouse, Dick and me.
2 weeks and finito.
April 14.
Will you visit me?
Truman?
It's... it's him again.
It is utterly inappropriate for me to talk to him.
Yes?
I'm sorry, he won't be able to make it.
Hello?
Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle.
I just got this telegram.
Has he seen it?
He won't read it.
Would you put him on, please?
Nelle, he won't talk.
Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down and put the phone on his ear, I need to speak to him.
All right.
Um, um, it's Nelle.
Truman.
"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote.
"Sorry that Truman was unable to make it here to the prison "for a brief word prior to necktie party.
"Whatever his reason for not showin' up, "I want him to know that I cannot condemn him for it.
"Not much time left, "but want you both to know that Ive been sincerely grateful "for your friendship through the years "and everything else.
"I'm not very good at these things.
"I have become extremely affectionate toward you both.
"But, harness time.
Adios, amigos.
Your friend, Perry." Well, I didn't expect to see you again.
You can visit for a few minutes.
Yeah.
No.
5 minutes.
Well, well.
He returns.
I don't know what you must think of me.
Well, you haven't been foremost on my mind lately, as you can probably imagine.
You got the letter?
Yes, I did.
It's true.
I understand why you didn't want to come.
I wouldn't be here either if I didn't have to.
You got that right.
You know Ricardo donated his eyes to science?
Next week, some blind man will be seeing what Dick used to see.
Yeah, you could be walking in Denver or somewhere, Truman, and suddenly these eyes will be staring at you.
That would be something, wouldn't it?
It would be. It would be.
You'll be watching?
I don't know, Ill be do you want me to?
I'd like to have a friend there.
Ok. Then I will.
It's all right.
I did everything I could.
It's ok.
I truly did.
I know.
It's time.
Mr. Capote.
Goodbye.
You're not rid of us yet.
We'll see you in a few minutes.
I wish I had Mr. Capote.
Mr. Capote.
Goodbye.
Nice to see you.
Perry Edward Smith.
For the crime of murder in the first degree, by order of the cour t of Finney county and the supreme court of the sovereign state of Kansas, you are sentenced to hang until you die.
"I will fear no evil: For thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me." You can say something if you want.
Is there anybody from the family here?
No, Perry.
Well, tell them I can't remember what I was gonna say for the life of me.
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread. as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
It was a terrible experience and I will never get over it.

But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances for beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away. to reveal a beautiful enchantress.
The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late for she had seen that there was no love in his heart .
And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there .
Ashamed of his monstrous form the beast concealed himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose which would bloom until his 21st year.
If he could learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell then the spell would be broken.
If not,he would be doomed to remain a beastfor all time.
As the years passed he fell into despair and lost all hope for who could ever learn to love a beast?

Belle, it's about time you got your head out of those books and paid attention to more important things.
Like me.
The whole town's talking about it.
It's not right for a woman to read.
Soon she starts getting ideas and thinking.
Gaston, you are positively primeval.
Why, thank you, Belle.

You always say that.

My daughter? Odd?
Where would you get an idea like that?
Oh, I don't know. It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here .
There's no one I can really talk to.
What about that Gaston?
H-He's a handsome fella.
He's handsome, all right,and rude and conceited and Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

I guess I should've taken... Wait a minute.
No. Let's go this way .

His mustache tickles, Mama!
Oh! Hello!
Brramm Uh-oh.
Rrrr...  There's a stranger here.
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.
He was cold and wet, so Master, I'd like to take this moment to say I was against this from the start .
It was all his fault. I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no... Who are you? What are you doing here?
I-I-I was lost in the woods and You are not welcome here!
I-I-I'm sorry.
What are you staring at?
N-Nothing.
So, you've come to stare at the beast, have you?
Please, I meant no harm!
I-I just needed a place to stay .
I'll give you a place to stay!
No, no, please! No! No!
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?
Yep, this is her lucky day .
I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding.
First I better go in there and propose to the girl.
And you, Lefou, now, when Belle and I come out that door Oh, I know! I know!
I-I strike up the band!
Not yet!
Sorry.
Oh!
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.
You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.
This is the day... This is the day your dreams come true.
What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty! Here. Picture this.
A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting on the fire and my little wife massaging my feet while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs.
We'll have six or seven.
Dogs?
No, Belle.Strapping boys like me. Imagine that.
Do you know who that little wife will be?
Let me think.
You, Belle.
Gaston, I'm ....I'm speechless.
I really don't know what to say .
Say you'll marry me.
I'm very sorry, Gaston, but but I just don't deserve you!
So, how'd it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife .
Make no mistake about that.
Touchy!
Is he gone?  Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless Madame Gaston Can't you just see it Madame Gaston his little wife No, sir, not me I guarantee it, I want much more than this provincial life I want adventure in the great wide somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more than they've got planned Philippe! What are you doing here? Where's Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.
What is this place?
Philippe, please, steady.
Steady.
Papa!
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?
Just had to invite him to stay, didn't we?
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch!
I was trying to be hospitable.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Papa? Papa?
Are you here?
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.
Now, Chip, I'll not have you making up such wild stories.
Really, Mama. I saw her.
Not another word. Into the tub.
But... What.. A girl! I saw a girl in the castle!
See, I told ya!
Irresponsible, devil-may-care, waxy eared, slack..jawed Papa?
Did you see that?
It's a girl!
I know it's a girl.
Don't you see? She's the one!
The girl we have been waiting for!
She has come to break the spell!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Papa?  - Papa?
Hello?
Is someone here?
Wait! I'm looking for my father.
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.
I-Is anyone here?
Hello Belle?
Papa!
H-H-How did you find me?
Oh, your hands are like ice.
We have to get you out of there.
Belle, I want you to leave this place.
Who's done this to you?
No time to explain.
You must go. Now!
I won't leave you.
What are you doing here?
Run, Belle!
Who's there? Who are you?
The master of this castle.
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?
Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!
But he could die. Please, I'll do anything.
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.
Oh, there must be some way I can . Wait!
Take me instead.
You?
You would take his place?
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!
If I did, would you let him go?
Yes, but you must promise to stay here forever.
Come into the light.
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!
You have my word.
Done!
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.
Wait!
Belle!
Wait!
No! Please spare my daughter.
Please!
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.
Let me out. Please let me out!
Uh, since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time I was thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable room.
Then again, maybe not.
You didn't even let me say goodbye.
I'll never see him again.
I didn't get to say goodbye.
I'll show you to your room.
My room? But I thought . You wanna... You wanna stay in the tower?
No.
Then follow me.
Say something to her.
Huh? Oh.
I, uh, hope you like it here .
The castle is your home now,so you can go anywhere you like except the west wing.
What's in the west It's forbidden!
Now, if you need anything, my servants will attend you.
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!
Who does she think she is?
That girl has tangled with the wrong man.
No one says no to Gaston!
Darn right!
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!
Why, it's more than I can bear.
More beer?
What for? Nothing helps.
I'm disgraced.
Who, you? Never!
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.
Gosh, it disturbs me to see you, Gaston Looking so Down in the dumps Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston Even when taking your lumps There's no man in town as admired as you You're everyone's favourite guy Everyone's awed and inspired by you And it's not very hard to see why No one's Slick as Gaston No one's quick as Gaston No one's neck's as in credibly thick as Gaston For there's no man in town Half as manly Perfect A pure paragon You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on No one's been like Gaston a kingpin like Gaston No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston As a specimen yes, I'm intimidating My, what a guy that Gaston Give 5 hurrahs Give 12 hip -hips Gaston is the best and the rest is all drips No one Fights like Gaston Do uses lights like Gaston In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston For there's no one as burly and brawny As you see I've got biceps to spare Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny That's right!
And every last in chofme's covered with hair No one hits like Gaston Matches wits like Gaston In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston I'm especially good at expectorating. Ptooey!
Ten points for Gaston When I was a lad late four dozen eggs Every morning to help me get large And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs So I'm roughly the size Of a barge No one Shoots like Gaston Makes those beauts like Gaston Then goes tromping a round wearing boots like Gaston I use antlers in all Of my decorating My, what a guy Gaston Help! Someone help me!
Maurice?
Please! Please, I need your help.
He's got her... He's got her locked in the dungeon!
Who?
Belle. We must go. Not...Not a minute to lose.
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.
Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous beast!
Is it a big beast?
Huge!
With a long, ugly snout?
Hideously ugly!
And sharp, cruel fangs?
Yes, yes! Will you help me?
All right, old man. We'll help you out.
You will? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Crazy old Maurice.
He's always good for a laugh.
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?
Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.
Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking A dangerous pastime I know But that wacky old cootis Belle's father And his sanity's only so -so Now, the wheels in my head have been turning Since I looked at that loony old man See, I promised myself I'd be married to Belle And right now I'm evolving a plan If I...  - Yes?
Then we...  - No, would she?
Guess!
Now I get it!
Let's go!
Let's go!
No one Plots like Gaston Takes cheap shots like Gaston Plans to persecute harmless Crack pots like Gaston So his marriage we so on will be celebrating My, what a guy Gaston Will no one help me?
Who is it?
Mrs Potts, dear.
I thought you might like a spot of tea.
But you're... You're a... Oh! Careful.
This is impossible!
I know it is, but here we are .
I told you she was pretty, Mama,didn't I?
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now. Don't spill.
Thank you.
Wanna see me do a trick?
Chip!
Oops, sorry.
That was a very brave thing you did, my dear.
We all think so.
But I've lost my father my dreams, everything.
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.You'll see.
Oh, listen to me...jabberin' on while there's a supper to get on the table.
Chip?
Bye!
Well, now, what shall we dress you in for dinner?
Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers .
Oh, how embarrassing!
Ahem. Ah, here we are!
You'll look ravishing in this one!
That's very kind of you, but I'm not going to dinner.
Ah, but you must!
Ahem, ahem... Dinner is served.
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.
Why isn't she here yet?
Oh, try to be patient, sir.
The girl has lost her father and her freedom all in one day .
Master, have you thought that perhaps this girl could be the one to break the spell?
Of course I have! I'm not a fool.
Good! So, you fall in love with her she falls in love with you, and poof! The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere. These things take time.
But the rose has already begun to wilt.
Oh, it's no use.
She's so beautiful and I'm... Well, look at me!
Oh, you must help her to see past all that.
I don't know how .
Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable.
Straighten up. Try to act like a gentleman.
Ah, yes. When she comes in, give her a dashing, debonair smile.
Come, come. Show me the smile.
But don't frighten the poor girl.
Impress her with your rapier wit.
But be gentle.
Shower her with compliments.
But be sincere .
And above all, you must control your temper!
Here she is!
Good evening.
Well, where is she?
Who? Oh, ha ha ha! The girl, yes. The girl.
Well, actually, she's in the process of... Circumstances being what they are... Uh, she's not coming.
What!
Oh, dear. Your Grace!
Your Eminence! Let's not be hasty!
I thought I told you to come down to dinner!
I'm not hungry.
You'll come out or I'll... I'll break down the door!
Master, I could be wrong,but that may not be the best way to win the girl's affections.
Please attempt to be a gentleman.
But she is being so difficult.
Gently, gently.
Will you come down to dinner?
No!
Suave, gently.
It would give me great pleasure if you would join me for dinner.
And we say please.
Please.
No, thank you.
You can't stay in there forever!
Yes, I can.
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!
If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all!
Oh, dear. That didn't go very well at all, did it?
Lumiere, stand watch at the door and inform me at once if there is the slightest change.
You can count on me, mon capitaine.
Well, we might as well go downstairs and start cleaning up.
I ask nicely, but she re fuses.
Wh-Wh-What... What does she want me to do, beg?
Show me the girl.
But the master's really not so bad once you get to know him.
Why don't you give him a chance?
I don't want to get to know him.
I don't want to have anything to do with him.
I'm just fooling myself.
She'll never see me as anything but a monster.
It's hopeless.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
I've been burnt by you before.
Zut alors!
She has emerged!
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters.
But I'm not sleepy .
Yes, you are .
No, I'm not.
I work and I slave all day long, and for what?
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!
Oh, stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.
Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn!
After all, he did say please.
But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper,he'll never break the... Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle.
I am Cogsworth,head of the household.
This is Lumiere.
En chante, cherie.
If there's... stop that... anything we... please... can do...to make your stay more comfortable... AOh I am a little hungry.
You are? Hear that? She's hungry!
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.
Remember what the master said.
Oh, pishtosh! I'm not about to let the poor child go hungry.
All right, fine. Glass of water, crust of bread and then... Cogsworth, I am surprised at you!
She's not a prisoner. She's our guest!
We must make her feel welcome here .
Right this way, mademoiselle.
Well, keep it down.If the master finds out about this,it will be our necks .
Of course, of course.
But what is dinner without a little music?
Mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax.
Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents your dinner.

If you're stressed lt's fine dining we suggest Be our guest, be our guest Be our guest Life is so unnerving For a servant who's not serving He's not whole without a soul to wait up on Get off!
Ah, those good old days when we were useful Huh?
Suddenly those good old days are gone Oh!
Ten years we've been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise A chance to use our skills Most days we just lay a round the castle Flabby, fat and lazy You walked in and upsy-daisy lt's a guest, it 's a guest Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed Wine's been poured and thank the Lord I've had the napkins freshly pressed With dessert, she'll want tea And my dear, that's fine with me While the cups do their soft-shoe in' I'll be bubblin', I'll be brewin' I'll get warm, pipin' hot Heaven sakes, is that a spot Clean it up We want the company impressed We've got a lot to do. ls it one lump or two For you, our guest She's our guest.

Be our guest Be our guest...Be our guest Please be our....Guest Bravo! That was wonderful!
Thank you.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
Oh, I couldn't possibly go to bed now .
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.
Enchanted!
Who said anything about the castle being enchanted?
It was you, wasn't it?
I figured it out for myself.
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.
Oh, would you like a tour?
Wait a second. Wait a second.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
We can't let her go poking around in certain places, if you know what I mean.
Perhaps you'd like to take me.
I'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle.
Oh, well! Actually, I... Yes, I do.
As you can see, the pseudo-facade was stripped away to reveal the minimalist rococo design.
Note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings.
This is yet another example of the late neoclassic Baroque period.
And, as I always say, if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.
Where was I?
As you were!
Now, then, if I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the... Uh, mademoiselle?
What's up there?
Where? There? Oh, nothing.
Absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing.
Dusty, dull, very boring.
Ah, so that's the west wing!
Nice going.
I wonder what he's hiding up there .
Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
That's, uh, uh... Mademoiselle would, uh, like to, uh, uh, see something else?
We have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to... Maybe later.
Uh, the... the gardens or, or the... the library perhaps?
You have a library?
Yes! Oh, indeed.
With books.
Scads of books!
Mountains of books!
Forests of books!
Cascades!
Cloudbursts!
Swamps of books!
More books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime.
Books on every subject ever studied by every author who ever set pen to paper.
by every author who ever set pen to paper.
Oh, oh.
Why did you come here?
I'm... I'm sorry.
I warned you never to come here!
I didn't mean any harm.
Do you realize what you could have done?
Please! Stop!
Get out!
No!
Get out!
Where are you going?
Promise or no promise I can't stay here another minute.
No, wait, please!
Please wait!
No!
Here, now. Don't do that.
Just hold still.
That hurts!
If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much!
Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened.
If you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away.
Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing!
Well, you should learn to control your temper!
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.
By the way, thank you for saving my life .
You're welcome.
I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night but he said you'd make it worth my while.
I'm listening.
It's like this.
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle.
But she needs a little persuasion.
Turned him down flat!
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.
He was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is, Belle would do anything to keep him from being locked up.
Yeah, even marry him.
So you want me to throw her father into the asylum unless she agrees to marry you.
Oh, that is despicable!
I love it!
If no one will help me, then I'll go back alone!
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes!
I'll find that castle and somehow, I... I'll get her out of there.
Belle! Maurice!
Oh, well. Guess it's not gonna work after all.
They have to come back sometime.
And when they do, we'll be ready for them.
Lefou, don't move from that spot until Belle and her father come home.
But... But I... Ah, nuts!
I've never felt this way about anyone.
I want to do something for her, but what?
Well, there's the usual things.
Flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep.
Ah, no, no, it has to be something very special.
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute!
Belle?
There's something I want to show you.
But first, you have to close your eyes.
It's a surprise.
Can I open them?
No, no. N-Not yet.
Wait here.
Now can I open them?
All right. Now!
I can't believe it!
I've never seen so many books in all my life .
You... You like it?
It's wonderful!
Then it's yours.
Oh, thank you so much.
Would you look at that!
I knew it would work.
What? What works?
It's very encouraging.
Isn't this exciting?
I didn't see anything.
Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done in the kitchen.
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.
There's something sweet and almost kind But he was mean And he was coarse and unrefined And now he's dear and so unsure I wonder why I didn't see it there before She glanced this way I thought l saw And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw No, it can't be I'll just ignore But then she's never looked at me that waybefore New and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought That this could be .... true.. That he's no Prince Charming But there's something in him That I simply didn't see Well, who'd have thought Well, bless my soul Well, who'd have known Well, who indeed And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own It's so peculiar, wait and see We'll wait a see A few days more There maybe something there that wasn't there before You know, perhaps there is something there that wasn't there before What?
There maybe something there that wasn't there before What's there, Mama?
Shh.
I'll tell you when you're older.
Right, then, you all know why we're here .
We have exactly 1 2 hours, 36 minutes and 15 seconds to create the most magical,spontaneous romantic atmosphere known to man or beast.
Right. Need I remind you that as the last petal falls from this rose the spell will never be broken!
Very well.
You all know your assignments.
Half of you to the west wing, half of you to the east wing the rest of you,come with me.
Lighten up, Cogsworth, and let nature take its course.
It's obvious there's a spark between them.
Yes, but there's no harm in fanning the flames, you know... a little.
Besides, they must fall in love tonight If we ever expect to be human again.
Ah, human again.
Human again.
Yes, think what that means.
I'll be cooking again Be good-looking again With a mademoiselle on each charm When I'm human again Only human again Poised and polished and gleaming with charm I'll be courting again Chic and sporting again Which should cause Several husbands alarm I'll hop down off this shelf and tout suite be myself I can't wait to be human again Be human again Only human again We'll be knick-knacks and what-nots no more When we're human again Good and human again Oh, cherie, we'll be only top drawer I'll wear lipstick and rouge And I won't be so huge Why I'll easily fit through that door I'll exude savoir faire I'll wear gowns I'll have hair It's my birth to be human again When we're human again Only human again When the world once more starts making sense I'll unwind for a change Really that would be strange Can I help it I fl'm t- t- tense In a shack by the sea I'll sit back sipping tea Let my early retirement commence Far from fools made of wax I'll get down to brass tacks and relax When I'm human again So sweep fast round the floor Let's let some light in the room I can feel I can tell Someone might break the spell Any day now Shine up the brass on the door Alert the dustbin and broom I fit all goes as planned Our time maybe at hand Any day now Open the shutters and let in some air Put these here And put those over there Sweep up the years Of sadness and tears And throw them away We'll be human again Only human again When the girl finally sets us all free Cheeks a-bloomin' again We're assumin' again We'll assume our long lost joie de vivre We'll be playin' again Holiday in 'again And we 're prayin' its' A.S.A.P.
We will push We will shove They will both fall in love And we'll finally be human again There never was a story of more love Than this of Juliet and her Romeo Could you read it again?
Here, why don't you read it to me?
Uh, all right.
I can't.
You mean, you never learned?
I learned... a little.
It's just been so long.
Well, here, I'll help you.
Let's start here.
Here.
Okay. ''Twoh--'' 'Two.' ''Two.'' I knew that.
'Two households...' We'll be dancing again We'll be twirling again We'll be whirling around with such ease When we're human again Only human again We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes We'll be floating again We'll be gliding again Stepping, striding As fine as you please Like a real human does I'll be all that I was On that glorious morn when we're finally reborn And we 're all of us human Again Tonight is the night.
I'm not sure I can do this.
You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.
Bold! Daring!
There will be music, romantic candlelight provided by myself.
And when the moment is right, you confess your love .
Yes, I con... I, I... No, I can't.
Look, You care for the girl, don't you?
More than anything.
Well, then you must tell her.
Voila! Oh, you look so... so... Stupid.
Not quite the word I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more off the top.
Your lady awaits.
Tale as old as time True as it can be Barely even friends Then somebody bends Unexpectedly Just a little change Small to say the least Both a little scared Neither one prepared Beauty and the beast Ever just the same Ever a surprise Ever as before Ever just as sure As the sun will rise Tale as old as time Tune as old as song Bitters weet and strange Finding you can change Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun Rising in the east Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the beast Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the beast Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.
Good night, love .
Belle?
Are you happy here with me?
Yes.
What is it?
If only I could see my father again just for a moment.
I miss him so much.
There is a way .
This mirror will show you anything anything you wish to see.
I'd like to see my father, please.
Papa! Oh, no!
He's sick. He may be dying, and he's all alone.
Then you-you must go to him.
What did you say?
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.
You mean, I'm free?
Yes.
Oh, thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way .
Take it with you so you'll always have a way to look back and remember me.
Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.
Well, Your Highness, I must say everything is going just swimmingly.
I knew you had it in your heart.
I let her go.
Yes, yes, splen... You what?
How could you do that?
I had to.
Yes, but, but, but... but why?
Because I love her.
He did what?
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
She's going away?
But he was so close.
After all this time, he's finally learned to love .
That's it then.
That should break the spell!
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.
Now it's too late.
Papa?
They're back.
Belle!
Shh.
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I missed you so much!
But the beast... Did you... How did you escape?
I didn't escape, Papa.
He... He let me go.
That horrible beast?
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.
Hi!
Oh, a stowaway.
Why, hello there, little fella.
Y... Didn't think I'd see you again.
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us any more?
Oh, Chip. Of course I do.
It's just that... May I help you?
I've come to collect your father.
My father?
Don't worry, mademoiselle.
We'll take good care of him.
My father's not crazy!
He was raving like a lunatic!
We all heard him, didn't we?
Yes!
No, I won't let you!
Belle?
Maurice, tell us again, old man.
Just how big was the beast?
He was... I mean, he was... he was, uh, enormous!
I'd... I'd say at least eight, uh, no, more like ten feet!
Well, you don't get much crazier than that!
It's true, I tell you!
Get him out of here!
Let go of me!
No! You can't do this!
Poor Belle.
Oh, it's a shame about your father.
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding if... If what?
If you marry me.
What?
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.
Never!
Have it your way!
Belle? Let go of me!
My father's not crazy and I can prove it!
Show me the beast.
Is it dangerous?
Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone.
Please, I-I know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle.
He's my friend.
If I didn't know better I'd think you had feelings for this monster.
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are!
She's as crazy as the old man!
The beast will make off with your children.
He'll come after them in the night.
No!
We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall!
I say we kill the beast!
We're not safe until he's dead He'll come stalking us at night Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free So it 's time to take some action, boys It's time to follow me Through the mist, through the woods through the darkness and the shadows It's a nightmare but it 's one exciting ride Say a prayer, then we're there at the draw bridge of a castle And there's something truly terrible inside lt's a beast He's got fangs, razor sharp ones Massive paws, killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we 're not coming home Till he's dead Good and dead Kill the beast No, I won't let you do this.
If you're not with us, you're against us.
Bring the old man!
Get your hands off me!
We can't have them running off to warn the creature!
Let us out!
We'll rid the village of this beast!
Who's with me?
I am! I am!
I am!
Light your torch, mount your horse Screw your courage to the sticking place We 're counting on Gaston to lead the way Through a mist, to a wood where within a haunted castle Something's lurking That you don't see every day lt's a beast One as tall as a mountain We won't rest Till he's good and deceased Sally forth, tally-ho Grab your sword and your bow Praise the Lord and here we go We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!
I have to warn the beast.
This is all my fault.
0Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?
Now, now .
We'll think of something.
We don 't like what we don 't understand In fact, it scares us And this monster is mysterious at least Bring your guns, bring your knives Save your children and your wives We'll save our village And our lives We'll kill the beast I knew it. I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up.
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all.
Could it be?
Is it she?
Sacrebleu! Invaders!
Encroachers!
And they have the mirror!
Warn the master. If it's a fight they want, we'll be ready for them.
Who's with me?
Take whatever booty you can find.
But remember, the beast is mine!
Hearts ablaze, banners high We go marching in to battle Unafraid although the danger just in creased Raise the flag, sing the song Here we come 50 strong And 50 Frenchmen can 't be wrong Let 's kill the beast Pardon me, Master.
Leave me in peace.
But, sir, the castle is under attack!
Kill the beast Kill the beast This isn't working.
Oh, Lumiere, we must do something!
Wait! I know!
Kill the beast Kill the beast What shall we do, Master?
It doesn't matter now .
Just let them come.
Kill the beast Kill the beast Now!
Yes!
Here we go!
What the devil?
Belle, look out!
You guys gotta try this thing.
Up here, you scurvy scum.
Now!
And stay out!
Get up!
Get up!
What's the matter, beast?
Too kind and gentle to fight back?
No!
Belle!
No, Gaston, don't!
Let's go, Philippe.
Come on out and fight!
We re you in love with her, beast?
Did you honestly think she'd want you when she had someone like me?
It's over, beast!
Belle is mine!
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, don't hurt me.
I'll do anything. Anything!
Get out!
Beast!
Belle.
Belle?
You came back.
You... You came back.
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them... Oh, this is all my fault.
If only I'd gotten here sooner.
Maybe it's better... it's better this way .
Don't talk like that.
You'll be all right.
We're together now. Everything's going to be fine, you'll see.
At least I got to see you one last time.
No! No!
Please! Please!
Please don't leave me.
I love you.
Belle, it's me!
It is you!
Lumiere!
Cogsworth!
Mrs Potts!
Look at us!
Mama! Mama!
Oh, my goodness!
It is a miracle!
Ah, I'amour.
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.
I beg your pardon, old friend, uh, but I believe I told you.
No, you didn't. I told you!
You most certainly did not, you pompous, paraffiln-headed peabrain!
En garde, you-you overgrown pocket watch!
Take that!
Stop shoving.
Are they gonna live happily ever after, Mama?
Of course, my dear.
Of course.
Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?

Well, it works both ways.
We have front-row seats for this theater of mass destruction.
The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundations of 12 buildings with explosives.
In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges and a few blocks will be reduced to smouldering rubble.
I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.
Suddenly I realize that all of this, the gun, the bombs, the revolution, has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.
The big moosie slobbering all over me, that was Bob.
We're still men.
Yes, we're men.
Men is what we are.
Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the oestrogen.
That was where I fit They'll have to drain my pecs again.
..between those huge sweating tits that hung enormous, the way you'd think of God's as big.
OK, you cry now.
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.
For six months, I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.
With insomnia, nothing's real.
Everything's far away.
Everything's a copy of a copy of a copy.
When deep space exploration ramps up, it'll be the corporations that name everything.
The IBM Stellar Sphere.
The Microsoft Galaxy.
The Planet Starbucks.
I need you out of town this week to cover some red flags.
It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.
You want me to deprioritize my reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.
He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.
Like so many others, I had become a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.
Yes. I'd like to order the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.
Please hold.
Anything clever, like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.
The Klipsk personal office unit.
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.
Or the Ohamshab sofa with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.
I'd flip through catalogues and wonder "What kind of dining set defines me as a person?" I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections, proof that they were crafted by the honest, hard-working, indigenous peoples of Please hold.
..wherever.
We used to read pornography.
Now it was the Horchow collection.
No. You can't die of insomnia.
What about narcolepsy?
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.
You need to lighten up.
Can you please just give me something?
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
Chew some valerian root and get more exercise.
Hey, come on.
I'm in pain.
You wanna see pain?
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.
See the guys with testicular cancer.
That's pain.
I always wanted three kids two boys and a girl.
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
We never could agree on anything.
Well, I... She She had her first child last week.
A girl.
With... With her... With her new husband.
Fuck!
Thank God, you know I'm glad for her.
She deserves Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us.
Thank you, Thomas.
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage.
And that gives me strength.
We give each other strength.
It's time for the one-on-ones.
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example and really open ourselves up.
Could you find a partner?
And this is how I met the big moosie.
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.
My name is Bob.
Bob?
Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.
You know that chest expansion programme on late-night TV?
That was his idea.
I was a juicer.
You know, using steroids?
Diabonal and Wisterol.
Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christ sakes.
And now I'm bankrupt.
I'm divorced.
My two grown kids won't even return my phone calls.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big, rubbery one.
Go ahead,... Cornelius.
You can cry.
And then... something happened.
I let go.
That's really good.
Lost in oblivion.
Dark and silent and complete.
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.
It's OK.
Babies don't sleep this well.
I became addicted.
If I didn't say anything people always assumed the worst.
They cried harder... then I cried harder.
Now we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra I wasn't really dying.
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.
I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light.
It moves over your body, healing you.
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe and step forward through the back door of the room.
Where does it lead?
To your cave.
Step forward into your cave.
That's right.
You're going deeper into your cave.
And you're going to find your power animal.
Slide.
Every evening I died.
And every evening I was born again.
Resurrected.
Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.
Being there, pressed against his tits, ready to cry.
This was my vacation.
And she ruined everything.
This is cancer, right?
This chick, Marla Singer, did not have testicular cancer.
She was a liar.
She had no diseases at all.
I had seen her at Free And Clear, my blood parasites group, Thursdays.
Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.
And again, at Seize The Day, my tuberculosis, Friday night.
Marla, the big tourist.
Her lie reflected my lie.
And suddenly, I felt nothing.
I couldn't cry. So once again, I couldn't sleep.
Next group, after guided meditation, after we open our heart chakras, when it's time to hug, I'm gonna grab that bitch, Marla Singer, and scream.
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!
I hadn't slept in four days.
We'll just let that dry When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep.
And you're never really awake.
To begin tonight's communion, Chloe would like to say a few words.
Oh, yeah. Chloe.
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton would look if you made it walk around being extra nice to everybody.
Well, I'm still here.
But I don't know for how long.
That's as much certainty as anyone can give me.
But I've got some good news.
I no longer have any fear of death.
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
No-one will have sex with me.
I'm so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time.
I have pornographic movies in my apartment, and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
Thank you, Chloe.
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
Thank you, Chloe.
Now, let's ready ourselves for guided meditation.
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.
You step inside your cave and you walk If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.
Marla.
The scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.
But you can't.
..deeper into your cave as you walk.
You feel a healing energy all around you.
Now find your power animal.
Slide.
OK. Let's partner up.
Pick someone special to you tonight.
Hey.
We need to talk.
Sure.
I'm onto you.
What?
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
Sorry?
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath sense of the word, I know we're all dying.
But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
So?
So you're a tourist.
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis.
I saw you at testicular cancer!
I saw you practising this.
Practising what?
Telling me off.
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?
I'll expose you.
Go ahead. I'll expose you.
Come together. Let yourselves cry.
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?
It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee.
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.
I've been coming for over a year.
Why do you do it?
I don't know.
When people think you're dying, they listen to you instead of Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
Yeah. Yeah.
Share yourself... completely.
Look, you don't want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.
Really?
I'm not kidding. I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this.
You gotta find somewhere else to go.
Candystripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.
No, wait a second. Hold on.
We'll split up the week, OK?
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.
You're kidding.
I dunno. Am I?
No. No.
What do you want?
I'll take the parasites.
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.
I want brain parasites.
I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.
I want that.
You can't have the whole brain.
So far, you have four. I only have two.
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.
Now we both have three Hey! You left half your clothes.
What, are you selling those?
Yes!
I'm selling some clothes!
So! We each have three. That's six.
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.
The girl had done her homework.
No. No. I want bowel cancer.
That's your favorite too?
Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Look, we'll split it.
Take the first and third Sunday.
Deal.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
How's this for not making a big thing?
Hey, Marla!
Marla!
Maybe we should exchange numbers.
Should we?
We might wanna switch nights.
This is how I met Marla Singer.
Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?
Travis? Any of the stupid names you give each night?
You wake up at SeaTac.
You wake up at O'Hare.
Dallas Fort Worth.
Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.
The check-in for that flight isn't for another two hours, sir.
This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.
You wake up at Air Harbor International.
If you wake up at a different time, in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?
Everywhere I travel, tiny life.
Single-serving sugar and cream.
Single pat of butter.
The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.
Shampoo-conditioner combos.
Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.
The people I meet on each flight, they're single-serving friends.
Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together.
That's all we get.
Welcome!
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.
The infant went through the windshield.
A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.
The rear differential locks up.
The teenager's braces are stuck to the ashtray.
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.
The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.
Now, should we initiate a recall?
The father must have been huge.
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?
Very modern art.
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.
Multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, C.
A x B xC equals X.
If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
You wouldn't believe.
Which car company do you work for?
A major one.
Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing, I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.
Anything.
Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row and would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties listed on the safety card, please ask a flight attendant to reseat you." It's a lot of responsibility.
Wanna switch seats?
No. I'm not sure I'm the man for that particularjob.
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.
The illusion of safety.
Yeah. I guess so.
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes?
So you can breathe.
Oxygen gets you high.
In a catastrophic emergency, you take giant panic breaths.
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.
It's all right here.
Emergency water landing, 600mph.
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
That's That's an interesting theory.
What do you do?
What do you mean?
What do you do for a living?
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
We have the exact same briefcase.
Soap.
Sorry?
I make and I sell soap.
The yardstick of civilization.
And this is how I met Tyler Durden.
Did you know if you mix gasoline and frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?
No, I did not. Is that true?
That's right.
One can make all kinds of explosives with simple household items.
Really?
If one was so inclined.
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting single-serving friend I have ever met.
Everything on a plane is single-serving Oh, I get it. Very clever.
Thank you.
How's it working out for you?
What?
Being clever?
Great.
Keep it up, then. Right up.
A question of etiquette.
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
How I came to live with Tyler is Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.
Was it ticking?
Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.
Sorry, throwers?
Baggage handlers.
But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have got to call the police.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Nine times out of ten it's an electric razor.
But... every once in a while it's a dildo.
It's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.
We have to use the indefinite article, a dildo, never your dildo.
I don't own I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.
My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.
Never mind.
Hey! That's my car!
Home was a condo on the 15th floor of a filing cabinet for widows and professionals.
The walls were solid concrete.
A foot of concrete is important when your next-door neighbor has to watch game shows at full volume.
Or when a blast of debris that used to be your personal effects blows out of your windows and sails flaming into the night.
I suppose these things happen.
There's... nothing up there.
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
Do you have somebody you can call?
How embarrassing.
A houseful of condiments and no food.
The police later told me the pilot light might have gone out letting out just a little bit of gas.
That gas could have filled the condo.
1700 square feet with high ceilings for days and days.
Then the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.
Yeah?
I can hear you breathing If you ask me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him.
Hello?
Who's this?
Tyler?
Who is this?
We met... We met on the airplane.
We had the same suitcase?
The clever guy?
Oh, yeah. Right.
I called a second ago. There was no answer.
I'm at a payphone.
Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.
So what's up?
Well.
You're not gonna believe this.
You know, it could be worse.
A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
There's always that. I don't know.
When you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it.
That's the last sofa I'll need.
Whatever happens, that sofa problem is handled.
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
I was close to being complete.
Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
All gone.
All gone.
Do you know what a duvet is?
A comforter.
It's a blanket.
Just a blanket. Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is?
Is this essential to our survival in the hunter-gatherer sense?
No.
What are we, then?
I dunno. Consumers.
Right. We're consumers.
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.
What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.
Viagra. Olestra.
Martha Stewart.
Fuck Martha Stewart.
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
I say never be complete.
I say stop being perfect.
I say let's evolve.
Let the chips fall where they may.
But that's me, and I could be wrong.
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so What?
The things you own end up owning you.
Do what you like, man.
Oh, it's late.
Hey, thanks for the beer.
Yeah, man.
I should find a hotel.
What?
What?
A hotel?
Yeah.
Just ask, man.
What are you talking about?
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask.
What?
You called me because you needed a place to stay.
Oh, hey. No, no, no.
Yes, you did. So just ask.
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
Would... Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yeah.
Thanks.
I want you to do me a favor.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.
Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us slept, he worked.
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.
Someone has to switch the projectors at the exact moment that one reel ends and the next one begins.
You can see little dots come into the upper right corner of the screen.
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.
That's the cue for a changeover.
He flips the projectors, movie keeps going and the audience has no idea.
Why would anyone want this shitjob?
Because it affords him interesting opportunities.
Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films.
So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices first meet, that's when you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film.
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.
Nice, big cock.
Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work.
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on meringues, and as for the cream of mushroom soup Go ahead, tell 'em.
You get the idea.
You just want me to hit you?
Come on. Do me this one favor.
Why?
I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
No. But that's a good thing.
You can't know yourself if you haven't!
I don't wanna die without any scars.
Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
Oh, God. This is crazy.
So go crazy! Let it rip.
I don't know about this.
I don't either.
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!
That's right.
Where? Like, in the face?
Surprise me.
This is so fucking stupid.
Motherfucker!
He hit me in the ear!
Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
Ow, Christ!
Why the ear, man?
I fucked it up.
No, that was perfect.
No, it's all right.
It really hurts.
Right.
Hit me again.
No, you hit me. Come on!
We should do this again sometime.
Where's your car?
What car?
I don't know how Tyler found that house but he said he'd been there for a year.
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
Most of the windows were boarded up.
There was no lock on the front door from when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.
The stairs were ready to collapse.
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.
Neither would have surprised me.
Yep. That's you.
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
Yeah, thanks.
What a shithole.
Nothing worked.
Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.
There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.
That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.
What have we here?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.
By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV.
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.
Can I be next?
All right, man.
Lose the tie.
At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction.
Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.
Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.
The previous occupant had been a shut-in.
Hey, man. What are you reading?
Listen to this. It's an article written by an organ in the first person.
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me, Jack could not regulate his heart rate or breathing." There's a whole series of these.
I Am Jill's Nipples.
I Am Jack's Colon.
I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack.
After fighting, everything else in life got the volume turned down.
What?
You could deal with anything.
Have you finished those reports?
If you could choose, who would you fight?
I'd fight my boss, probably.
Really?
Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
I'd fight my dad.
I don't know my dad.
I mean, I know him, but He left when I was like, six years old.
Married this other woman and had some other kids.
He did this every six years.
He changes city and starts a new family.
Fucker's setting up franchises!
My dad never went to college.
So it was real important that I go.
That sounds familiar.
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance and say, "Dad, now what?" He says, "Get ajob." Same here.
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
Dad, now what?
He says, "I dunno. Get married." You can't get married.
I'm a 30-year-old boy.
We're a generation of men raised by women.
I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.
But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.
We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.
It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.
Polish my Scandinavian furniture.
I should have been looking for a new condo or haggling with my insurance company.
I should have been upset about my nice flaming little shit.
But I wasn't.
The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient.
Monday mornings, I just thought about next week.
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
Absolutely.
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
Because waste is a thief.
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?
You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
It was right in everyone's face.
Tyler and I just made it visible.
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.
Tyler and I just gave it a name.
Come on, you've gotta go home!
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.
Gentlemen!
Welcome to Fight Club.
The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.
The second rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club!
Third rule of Fight Club.
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out, the fight is over. Fourth rule.
Only two guys to a fight.
Fifth rule.
One fight at a time, fellas.
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.
And the eighth and final rule.
If this is your first night at Fight Club you have to fight.
This kid from work, Ricky, couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black.
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes when he trounced the maitre d' of a local food court.
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard, packing sounds over the yelling.
Or the wet choke when someone gasped and sprayed Stop!
You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.
But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.
Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man.
Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were outside of it.
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
Hemingway. You?
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
We all started seeing things differently.
Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms, trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
Is that what a man looks like?
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.
Now, self-destruction Excuse me.
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.
It wasn't about words.
The hysterical shouting was in tongues like at a Pentecostal Church.
Is that it?
Stop!
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.
But nothing mattered.
Cool.
Afterwards, we all felt saved.
Hey, man. How about next week?
How about next month?!
Irvine, you're in the middle.
New guy, you too.
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.
He fell down some stairs.
I fell down some stairs.
Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.
OK. Any historical figure.
I'd fight Gandhi.
Good answer.
How about you?
Lincoln.
Lincoln?
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Fuck!
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
Hello?
Where have you been the last eight weeks?
Marla?
How did you find me?
You left a forwarding number.
I haven't seen you at any support groups.
We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.
How do you know?
I cheated.
I found a new one.
Really?
It's for men only.
Like the testicle thing?
Look, this is a bad time.
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
They're really fucked-up people I'm on my way out.
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
I took what was left of a bottle.
It might have been too much.
Picture Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.
So you're staying in tonight, then?
Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death?
Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for two months and his door was never closed.
You won't believe this dream I had last night.
I can hardly believe anything about last night.
What are you doing here?
What?
This is my house.
What are you doing here?
Fuck you!
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
Limber, though.
Silly cooze.
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.
Guess who's on the other end?
I knew the story before he told me.
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Do you think it'll live up to its name?
Or will it just be a death hairball?
Prepare to evacuate soul.
Ten, nine,... eight How could Tyler, of all people, think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?
Five, four Hang on.
You got here fast.
Did I call you?
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
Oh, fuck!
Somebody called the cops.
Hey, where's 513?
End of the hall.
The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl.
She has lost faith in herself.
Miss Singer, let us help you!
She's a monster!
You have every reason to live.
She's infectious human waste!
Miss Singer!
Good luck trying to save her!
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
You're gonna have to keep me up all night.
Un-fucking-believable.
He was obviously able to handle it.
You know what I mean, you fucked her.
No, I didn't.
Never?
No.
You're not into her, are you?
No! God, not at all.
I am Jack's raging bile duct.
Are you sure? You can tell me.
Believe me, I'm sure.
Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
That's good.
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.
The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
My God.
I haven't been fucked like that since grade school.
How could Tyler not go for that?
The other night, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.
Marla doesn't need a lover, just a caseworker.
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
She invaded my support groups and now my home.
Hey, hey. Sit down.
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.
Why would I Say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.
Now promise me. You promise?
Yeah, I promise.
Promise?
I just said, I promise! What That's three times you promised.
If only I had wasted a few minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die, none of this would have happened.
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!
I could have moved to another room.
On the third floor where I might not have heard them.
But I didn't.
What are you doing?
Just going to bed.
Wanna finish her off?
No. No, thank you.
I've found a cigarette.
Who were you talking to?
Shut up.
I became the calm little center of the world.
I was the Zen master.
I wrote little haiku poems.
I e-mailed them to everyone.
Is that your blood?
Some of it, yeah.
You can't smoke in here.
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.
Get yourself together.
I got right in everyone's hostile face.
Yes, these are bruises from fighting.
Yes, I'm comfortable with that.
I am enlightened.
You give up the condo life, give up all your flaming worldly possessions, move to a dilapidated house in a toxic waste area, and you have to come home to this.
Hello.
This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.
Yes.
I don't know if you're aware, but someone sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
No, I wasn't aware of that.
I am Jack's cold sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.
The dynamite Dynamite?
left a residue of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
Do you know what this means?
No, what does it mean?
It means it was home-made.
I'm sorry. This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir.
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown out your pilot light days before the explosion.
The gas was just a detonator.
Who would go and do that?
I'll ask the questions.
Tell him.
Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property realigned my perceptions.
Excuse me. Are you there?
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.
Have you recently made enemies who might have access to home-made dynamite?
Enemies?
Reject civilization, especially material possessions.
Son, this is serious.
Yes, I know it's serious.
I mean that.
Yes, it's very serious.
Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me.
That condo was my life. OK?
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed.
It was me!
I'd like to thank the Academy.
Is this not a good time for you?
Just tell him you fucking did it!
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.
Are you still there?
Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
No. I may need to talk to you, so you let me know if you're gonna leave town.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
My parents pulled this exact same act for years.
The condom is the glass slipper of our generation.
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
You... dance all night.
Then you throw it away.
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
What?
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
It was worth every penny.
It's a bridesmaid's dress.
Someone loved it intensely for one day.
Then tossed it.
Like a Christmas tree.
So special.
Then bam!
It's on the side of the road.
Tinsel still clinging to it.
Like a sex crime victim.
Underwear inside out.
Bound with electrical tape.
Well then, it suits you.
You can borrow it sometime.
Get rid of her.
What? You get rid of her!
Don't mention me.
I am six years old again, passing messages between parents.
I really think it's time you left.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Not that we don't love your visits.
You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
Gotta get off Thanks. Bye.
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round Gonna get, need to get Gotta get You kids!
Why do you still waste time with her?
I'll say this about Marla.
At least she's trying to hit bottom.
And I'm not?
Feathers up your butt do not make you a chicken.
What are we doing tonight?
Tonight... we make soap.
Really?
To make soap, first we render fat.
The salt balance has to be just right so the best fat for soap comes from humans.
Wait, what is this place?
A liposuction clinic.
Pay dirt!
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!
Oh, God!
Give me another one.
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface.
Like in Boy Scouts.
It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
Keep stirring.
Once the tallow hardens, you skim off a layer of glycerin.
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust, you've got dynamite.
Yeah, with enough soap, one could blow up just about anything.
Tyler was full of useful information.
People found clothes got cleaner when washed at a certain point in the river.
You know why?
No.
Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river.
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
Once it mixed with the melted body fat, a white soapy discharge crept into the river.
May I see your hand, please?
What is this?
This is a chemical burn.
It will hurt more than any burn and it will leave a scar.
Meditation worked for cancer, it could work now.
Don't shut the pain out.
Oh, God!
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space.
Without pain or sacrifice, we would have nothing.
I tried not to think of the word searing of flesh.
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.
I'm going to my cave to find my power animal.
No! Don't deal with this the way those dead people do! Come on!
I get the point!
No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.
It's the greatest moment of your life, and you're off somewhere else!
I am not!
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.
If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?
Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you.
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!
I agree!
Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
I'm getting water!
You can use water and make it worse or Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
Please let me up!
First, you have to give up.
First, you have to know, not fear, know that some day, you're gonna die.
You don't know how this feels!
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.
Congratulations.
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.
Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.
God knows what they charged.
This is the best soap.
Why, thank you, Susan.
It was beautiful.
We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.
He was wearing his yellow tie.
I didn't wear a tie to work any more.
"The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club." I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.
"The second rule..." Is this yours?
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.
You find this. What would you do?
Well, I gotta tell you, I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that.
Because the person who wrote that is dangerous.
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap and then stalk from office to office with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered semiautomatic weapon, pumping round after round into colleagues and co-workers.
This might be someone you've known for years.
Someone very, very close to you.
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.
And I used to be such a nice guy.
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every piece of trash you pick up.
Compliance and Liability.
My tit's gonna rot off.
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
What do you mean?
I need you to check for a lump in my breast.
Go to a hospital.
I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
I don't know about this, Marla.
Please.
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.
Where are they, exactly?
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
No, no.
I got one for you.
Thanks for the thought.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, nothing.
Right there?
Feel anything?
No.
Well, make sure.
OK, I'm pretty sure.
You feel nothing?
No, nothing.
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
No problem.
I wish I could return the favor.
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.
I could check your prostate.
I think I'm OK.
Well, thanks, anyway.
Are we done?
Yeah, we're done.
See you... around.
Cornelius?
Cornelius!
It's me! Bob!
Hey, Bob.
We all thought you were dead.
No, no. Still here.
How are you, Bob?
Better than I've ever been in my whole life.
Really? Still remaining men together?
No, no.
I got something so much better now.
Really, what is it?
Well The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it.
And the second rule is I'm not supposed to talk about it.
And the third rule is Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
Look at my face, Bob.
That's fucking... fucking great.
I've never seen you there.
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I go Saturday.
Congratulations.
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?
Have you heard about the guy that invented it?
Yeah, actually I hear all kinds of things.
Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution and he sleeps only one hour a night.
He's a great man.
Do you know about Tyler Durden?
I didn't hurt you, did I?
Actually, you did.
Thank you for this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Fight Club.
This was mine and Tyler's gift.
Our gift to the world.
I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces.
Shut up!
Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.
I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived.
I see all this potential.
And I see it squandered.
Goddamn it, an entire generation pumping gas.
Waiting tables.
Slaves with white collars.
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.
Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.
We're the middle children of history.
No purpose or place.
We have no Great War.
No Great Depression.
Our great war is a spiritual war.
Our great depression is our lives.
We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars.
But we won't.
We're slowly learning that fact.
And we're very, very pissed off.
Yeah!
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah.
There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern.
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
Tyler Durden.
Who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
He don't own this place. I do.
How much money's he getting for this?
There is no money.
Free to all.
Ain't that something?
It is, actually.
Look, stupid fuck!
I want everybody out of here right now.
Hey!
You should join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?
You and your friend.
You hear me now?
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
Still not getting it.
OK, OK, I got it.
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
Back! All of you!
Everybody back!
Ah, Lou!
Come on, man!
We really like this place.
That's right, Lou. Get it out.
Shut the fuck up.
Oh, yeah!
Is that fucking funny?
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.
Unbelievable.
You don't know where I've been, Lou.
Oh, my God!
You don't know where I've been!
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
Fucking use the basement! Christ!
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!
On my mother's eyes.
Thanks, Lou.
You too, big guy.
We'll see you next week.
This week, each one of you has a homework assignment.
You're gonna go out. You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger.
You're gonna start a fight and you're gonna lose.
Excellent choice, sir.
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.
Son of a bitch!
Most people, normal people, do just about anything to avoid a fight.
Excuse me!
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary Jay! Go call 911!
Put the hose down.
Stop it! Stop it!
Sorry.
We need to talk.
Where to begin?
With your constant absenteeism?
With your unpresentable appearance?
You're up for review.
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
What?
Let's pretend.
You're the Department of Transportation, Someone informs you that this company installs front-seat mounting brackets that failed collision tests, brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles, and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive.
What then?
Are you threatening me?
No Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!
I have a better solution. Keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant.
In exchange for my salary, my job will be never to tell people these things that I know.
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit?
Security!
I am Jack's smirking revenge.
What the hell are you doing?
That hurt.
Why would you do that?
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
What are you doing?
Oh, God, no! Please! No!
For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.
No!
Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted, something horrible had been growing.
Look.
Give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again.
Then, at our most excellent moment together Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.
Telephone, computer, fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.
We now had corporate sponsorship.
This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.
Now, the center of Fight Club became the two men fighting.
The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.
Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel over the urine content of their soup.
I am Jack's wasted life.
Thank you, sir.
Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
Yeah, I heard.
There's one in Penns Grove too.
Bob even found one up in New Castle.
Did you start that one?
No, I thought you did.
No.
Stop for a second.
Hey, what are we doing?
Turn around.
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
What kind?
Human sacrifice.
Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
It's a gun.
What are you doing?
Meet me in the back.
Don't fuck around!
Meet me in the back.
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
What are you doing? Come on!
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.
Small, cramped basement apartment?
How did you know?
They give shitty apartments letters.
Raymond! You're going to die.
No!
Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.
Pick up your dental records. Know why?
There'll be nothing left of your face.
Oh, come on!
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?
S... S... Stuff.
Stuff?
Were the midterms hard?
I asked you what you studied!
Biology, mostly.
Why?
I don't know.
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!
The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be?
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!
Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
Animals.
Yeah. Animals and stuff.
Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
So you need more schooling.
Too much school.
Would you rather be dead?
No, please You'd rather die here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store?
Please, no.
I'm keeping your license.
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.
If you're not working to be a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead.
Now run on home.
Run, Forrest, run!
I feel ill.
Imagine how he feels.
Come on, this isn't funny!
What the fuck was the point of that?!
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K Hessel's life.
His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
You had to give it to him.
Come on.
He had a plan.
And it started to make sense in a Tyler-sort of way.
No fear. No distractions.
The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.
You are not your job.
You're not how much money you have in the bank.
You're not the car you drive.
You're not the contents of your wallet.
You're not your fucking khakis.
You are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.
I'll be out of your way in a sec.
You don't have to go.
Whatever.
No, I mean... It's OK.
Are you still going to groups?
Yeah.
Chloe's dead.
Wow, Chloe.
When did that happen?
Do you care?
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.
Yeah, well It was the smart move on her part.
Listen What are you getting out of all this?
What?
I mean, all this. Why do you keep Is this making you happy?
Yeah, well, sometimes.
I don't know. I don't understand.
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person?
What is... What is that?
What do you get out of it?
No... That's not the same thing at all.
It's totally different with us.
Us?
What do you mean by us?
I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
Hear what?
All that noise. Hold on.
No, wait!
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.
You're not talking about me, are you?
No.
What?
Playing doctor. What was going on there?
What are you talking about?
Nothing. Nothing.
I don't think so.
What do you want?
Look at me.
No. What?
What is that?!
It's nothing. Don't worry.
My God. Who did this?
A person.
Guy or girl?
What do you care?
What do you care if I ask?
Leave me alone.
You're afraid to say.
I am not. Let me go.
No! Talk to me.
Let go of me!
This conversation This conversation is over.
is over.
I just can't win with you, can I?
Hey, this is getting a little old!
What is... What is all this?
What do you think?
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
Hey!
Too young.
Sorry.
What's all that?
If the applicant is young, tell him he's too young.
Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Applicant?
If the applicant waits three days without food or shelter, he may enter and begin training.
Training for what?
You think this is a game?
You're too young to train here, end of story.
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.
Bad news, friend.
It's not gonna happen.
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
It's not the end of the world.
Just... go away.
Go.
You're trespassing and I will have to call the police.
Don't you look at me!
You're never getting in this fucking house!
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!
Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.
I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna get a shovel.
Got two black shirts?
Yes, sir.
Two pair of black pants?
Yes, sir.
One pair black boots? Black socks?
Yes, sir.
One blackjacket.
Yes, sir.
$300 personal burial money?
Yes, sir.
All right.
You're too old, fat man.
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.
Bob! Bob!
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
Space monkey.
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.
You are too fucking old, fatty!
And you... You're too fucking blond!
Get out of here, the both of you!
And so it went.
Listen up, maggots.
You are not special.
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.
Tyler built himself an army.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.
We are all part of the same compost heap.
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?
To what purpose?
For what greater good?
In Tyler we trusted.
When he was like, "You are not yourjob", I was like, "Yeah!" Hey, what's all this?
Hey!
What's going on?
We're celebrating.
What are we celebrating?
Go on.
Hey.
Let me get that for you.
The same great taste, Pepsi.
Ssh!
Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.
Could you tell us what you think has happened here?
We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism in the city somehow related to underground boxing clubs.
We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene of a four-alarm fire that broke out She's hot.
Back to you in the studio.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Holy shit!
Yeah!
What the fuck did you guys do?
Arson investigators are on the premises Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir.
The victory in the war against crime will not come overnight.
It will take dedication and commitment and, most of all, cooperation.
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However I gotta take a piss.
These are the first steps in a long journey.
That is why we have created Project Hope.
Bob.
Project Hope will be ajoint effort between the police and community leaders.
It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime.
Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
His balls are ice cold.
Hi. You're gonna call off your rigorous investigation.
You will publicly state there is no underground group or these guys are gonna take your balls.
They'll send one to the New York Times and one to the LA Times.
Look.
The people you are after are the people you depend on.
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.
Do not fuck with us.
Ball check!
Bob, you're this way.
Let's go.
I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.
Hey!
Yeah!
I felt like putting a bullet in every panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.
I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother those French beaches I'd never see.
I wanted to breathe smoke.
Where did you go, psycho boy?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Get him to a fucking hospital.
Yeah.
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.
After you, Mr Durden.
After you.
Something on your mind, dear?
No.
Yeah, why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem?
First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left the basements and it's Project Mayhem.
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.
Is this about you and me?
Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.
Fuck that. You should have told me.
Hey, Tyler!
Goddamn it, Tyler!
What do you want?!
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?
Oh You decide your level of involvement!
I will! I wanna know certain things first!
The first rule of Project Mayhem Shut up!
I wanna know what you're thinking.
Fuck what you know!
Forget about what you think you know about life, friendship, and especially about you and me.
What is that supposed to mean?
What are you doing?
What do you wish you'd done before you died?
Paint a self-portrait.
Build a house.
And you?
I don't know. Nothing.
Get in the right lane.
You have to know!
If you died now, how would you feel about your life?
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?
Come on!
Not good enough.
Stop fucking around! Tyler!
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
I am sick of all your shit!
OK, man.
Quit screwing around. Steer!
Look at you!
Steer!
Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!
Why? Why? What are you talking about?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
What?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.
Stop trying to control everything and just let go!
Let go!
All right. Fine.
Fine.
I'd never been in a car accident.
This must have been what all those people felt like before I filed them as statistics in my reports.
Goddamn!
We've just had a near-life experience!
In the world I see, you're stalking elk through the Grand Canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower.
And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying strips of venison in the empty car-pool lane of some abandoned superhighway.
Feel better, champ.
And then Tyler?
..Tyler was gone.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake The house had become a living thing.
Wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.
So many people moving, the house moved.
Planet Tyler.
I had to hug the walls.
Trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!
Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.
Hang on a second.
It's under control, sir.
Where's Tyler?
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not Right... OK.
I'm all alone.
My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.
I am Jack's broken heart.
What comes next in Project Mayhem only Tyler knows.
The second rule is you do not ask questions.
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!
Who are all these people?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
Tyler isn't here.
Tyler went away.
Tyler's gone.
Get some help!
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!
What happened? What happened?
We were on assignment. We were supposed to kill two birds with one stone.
Destroy a piece of corporate art Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.
We had it all worked out, sir.
It went smooth until Police! Freeze!
What?
They shot Bob.
They shot him in the head.
Fucking pigs!
Oh, God!
Those motherfuckers!
You morons.
You're running around in ski masks trying to blow things up?
What did you think was gonna happen?!
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!
Bury him.
What?
Take him to the garden and bury him.
Come on, people, let's go!
Get the fuck off!
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.
He's my friend and you're not burying him in the garden!
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
This is Bob.
Sir, in In Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Now, you listen to me.
This is a man and he has a name, and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?
Robert Paulsen.
He's a man and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?
I understand.
In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name... is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
Shut up! This is all over with!
Get the fuck out of here.
Tyler?
No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.
I need to see you I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.
I didn't know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.
I wish I could help you, sir.
Every city I went to, as soon as I set foot off the plane I knew a Fight Club was close.
Hey! Hey!
Taxi!
Look at my face. I'm a member.
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.
I'm not exposed to bespeak any such information to you nor would I, even if I had said information at this juncture,... be able.
You're a moron.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Tyler had been busy setting up franchises all over the country.
Was I asleep? Had I slept?
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?
We've just heard the stories.
What kind of stories?
Nobody knows what he looks like.
He has plastic surgery every three years.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
Is Mr Durden building an army?
I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.
Everywhere I went, I felt I'd already been there.
It was like following an invisible man.
The smell of dried blood, dirty, bare footprints circling each other.
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.
The feel of a floor still warm from a fight the night before.
I was always just one step behind Tyler.
His name is Robert Paulsen Welcome back, sir.
How have you been?
Do you know me?
Is this a test, sir?
No. This is not a test.
You were in here last Thursday.
Thursday?
You were standing where you are now, asking how good security is.
It's tight as a drum, sir.
Who do you think I am?
Are you sure this isn't a test?
No, this is not a test.
You're Mr Durden.
You're the one who gave me this.
Please return your seat backs to their full upright and locked position.
Yeah?
Marla, it's me.
Have we ever done it?
Done what?
Had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Stupid because it's yes or because it's no?
Is this a trick?
No. I need to know You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
We did make love?
Is that what you're calling it?
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.
You're sensitive, then you turn into an asshole.
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?
We just lost cabin pressure.
What did you just say?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name!
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?
I'm coming over!
I'm not there!
You broke your promise.
Jesus, Tyler.
You fucking talked to her about me.
What the fuck is going on?
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.
Why do people think that I'm you?
Answer me!
Sit.
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?
I think you know.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?
I... I don't know.
You got it.
No.
Do not fuck with us!
Say it.
Because Say it!
Because we're the same person.
That's right.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.
I don't understand this.
You wanted a way to change your life.
You could not do this on your own.
All the ways you wish you could be, that's me.
I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck.
I am smart, capable and, most importantly, I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
Oh, no.
Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
What?
This isn't possible. This is crazy.
People do it every day.
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.
They don't have the courage you have to just run with it.
You still wrestle with it, so sometimes you're still you.
We should do this again sometime.
At times, you imagine you're watching me.
If this is your first time, you have to fight.
Little by little, you're just letting yourself become Tyler Durden.
You are not yourjob or how much money you have!
No. You have a house.
Rented in your name.
You have jobs, a life.
You work nights because you can't sleep.
Or you stay up and make soap.
You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.
Oh, my God.
Now you see our dilemma.
She knows too much.
I think we're gonna have to talk about how this might compromise our goals.
What... What are you saying?
This is bullshit. This is bullshit, I'm not listening to this!
You are insane!
No. You're insane.
We simply do not have time for this crap.
It's called a changeover.
The movie goes on and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Sir! Are you checking out?
Yeah. Bill me.
Can you initial this list of phone calls?
When were these made?
Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.
Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
Is anybody here?
Déjà vu all over again.
With enough soap, one could blow up anything.
Oh, my God.
Who am I calling?
1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?
Hello?
1888 Franklin Street?
Yes. Can I help you?
Hello?
Yeah, yeah.
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.
Speaking.
OK, listen to me.
Something terrible is about to happen to your building.
It's under control, sir.
Excuse me?
Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!
They were burning their fingertips with lye.
This needs a tremendous act of faith on your part, but hear me out.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
A little more faith than that.
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.
You have every right to be I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.
Why is it free of charge?
Don't ask.
Whatever.
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.
Clean food, please.
In that case, may I advise against the clam chowder.
No clam chowder. Thank you.
You got about 30 seconds.
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?
I know it seems there's two sides to me Two sides?
You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
I know. But I realized something important.
What?
The nature of our relationship wasn't clear to me for reasons I won't go into.
I know I haven't treated you well.
Whatever.
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!
Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
What I've come to realize is that I really like you, Marla.
You do?
I really do.
I care about you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me.
Marla, your life is in danger.
What?
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.
Just go camping You're an insane person.
No. I've involved you in something terrible.
No. Shut up!
You're not safe.
Shut up!
Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
I know you did.
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.
You're spectacular in bed.
But you're intolerable.
You have very serious emotional problems.
Deep-seated problems for which you should seek professional help.
I know, and I'm sorry.
You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.
I can't do this any more.
I can't.
And I won't.
I'm gone.
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
Marla, you don't understand!
Leave me alone!
Marla, I am trying to protect you!
Let go!
I don't ever wanna see you again!
That's fine Here, wait right here!
Hold it right there! Shut up!
Take this money and get on this bus.
I promise I won't bother you again.
Shut up!
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.
Why are you doing this?
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!
If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.
Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
Tyler.
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Hello. I need you to arrest me.
I am the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for numerous acts of vandalism and assault all over this city.
In the metropolitan area, we had probably 200 members.
Chapters have sprung up in five or six other major cities already.
This is a tightly-regimented organization with many cells capable of operating independent of central leadership.
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.
That's our headquarters.
In the back, buried in the garden, you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
I believe the plan is to blow up the headquarters of these credit card companies and the TRW building.
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero.
You'll create total chaos.
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone call.
I really admire what you're doing.
What?
You're a brave man to order this.
You're a genius, sir.
You said if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem, even you, we gotta get his balls.
Don't fight.
It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.
It will set an example.
You're making a big mistake!
You said you'd say that.
I'm not Tyler Durden!
You told us you'd say that too.
All right. I am Tyler Durden.
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.
We're aborting this mission now.
You said you would definitely say that.
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!
Is somebody timing this?
Keep your mouth shut.
Shit!
Some of this information checks out.
Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
Be right there.
Hey, wait!
I got him.
Sir, we have to do this.
Stop fighting!
Where's the rubber band?
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!
Get down on the floor!
The first person that comes out of this door gets a lead salad! Understand?
Get away! Stay away!
I ran.
I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.
Then I ran some more.
What the fuck are you doing?
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.
Come on, then. I got us a great place to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.
Oh, Christ.
Now what are you doing?
I'm stopping this.
Why?
The greatest thing you've ever done.
I can't let this happen.
There are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
The buildings are empty.
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
You wanna make an omelette, you gotta break some eggs.
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.
If you know, I know.
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent all day thinking about the wrong ones.
You think?
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
Pull any one but the green one.
I asked you not to do that!
Fuck!
Tyler, get away from the van.
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!
Goddamn it!
You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
Cool it, Tyler!
Come on!
Don't go!
What?!
Three minutes.
This is it.
The beginning.
Ground zero.
I think this is about where we came in.
Do you have a speech for the occasion?
I'm sorry?
I still can't think of anything.
Flashback humor.
It's getting exciting now.
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.
Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history.
One step closer to economic equilibrium.
Why is she here?
Tying up loose ends.
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!
I beg you, please don't do this.
I'm not doing this.
We are doing this. This is what we want.
No.
I don't want this.
Right. Except you is meaningless now.
We have to forget about you.
You're a voice in my head.
You're a voice in mine!
Why can't I get rid of you?
You need me.
No. I don't. I really don't any more.
You created me. I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better.
Take some responsibility.
I do. I am responsible for all of it and I accept that.
So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off.
Have I ever let us down?
How far have you come because of me?!
I will bring us through this.
As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming and in the end you will thank me.
Tyler. Tyler.
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.
But this is too much. I don't want this.
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
Fuck you! I won't do it.
This can't be happening.
It's already done, so shut up!
60 seconds till CRI.
No.
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.
You're not real, that gun That gun isn't even in your hand.
The gun's in my hand.
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
Not my head, Tyler.
Our head.
Interesting.
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?
Hey. It's you and me.
Friends?
Tyler, I want you to really listen to me.
My eyes are open.
What's that smell?
Where is everybody?
Oh, no. What's going on?
Mr Durden!
Oh, my God!
Are you... Are you all right, sir?
Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
You look terrible, sir. What happened?
Nothing, it's no problem.
No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
You look awful. You need assistance.
I'm fine.
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.
Stop it!
Let her go.
Christ Almighty!
You!
Hi, Marla.
Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
You fucker! What kind of sick fucking game are you playing at?!
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!
Yeah, I know.
What happened?
Don't ask.
You're shot.
Yes, I'm shot.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe he's standing.
One tough motherfucker.
Who did this?
I did, actually.
Find some gauze.
You shot yourself?

and loss of innocence.
And, um, the exploitation of innocence, um, always appeals to me because, again, that happened in Tommy.
And it certainly began to happen with Tom and Barry the way they were bought.
Conjoined twins. Desolate location.
Cut off from everything.
Where they are. Where they grow up.
They're sold by their own father and they move out into the world.
What happens to them then?
L mean, it's all, uh, incredibly gothic.
these terrible nightmares.
She thought she was expecting triplets.
Doctors got it wrong.
And Mum passed away the next day.
Never even saw 'em.
And there they were, my two brothers.
Joined together.
Just here at the chest.
Peas in a pod.
The doctors wanted to try a separation surgery but Father would have none of it.
It was bad enough he'd lost his wife.
He wasn't havin'the doctors messin'about with his boys.
Father took us off to live out on the Head.
Didn't let no one near us.
No one knew us.
We didn't go to school like other kids.
Dad taught us everything.
They were grand times.
L trod the boards before l could walk.
L did a double act with me mum.
Zelda and Little Zak.
Ever heard of'em?
Music business now is no different to what it was then.
People want a show.
Punters wanna see something a bit different.
back in the late '50s and '60s you know, if l'm being honest, Zak Bedderwick was the king.
Whatever, whoever he wanted, he had.
He reckoned The Noize was gonna be the new Small Faces.
That Chris Dervish was gonna be the new Steve Marriot.
The band collapsed when Chris Dervish, the lead singer took his 1968 Ford Shelby for a swim in Staines Reservoir.
had left Zak Bedderwick bruised and pretty battered.
He hadn't had a pop hit of any kind for some years.
Uh, by 1974, he was ready to, uh, raise the stakes.
When my father signed that contract he believed he'd secured Tom and Barry an income.
If you would just sign there, please.
to look after themselves.
Dad?
So many wanted to claim them.
In some ways even more now than when they were alive but there's never been, like, any real concern or love.
The contract stipulated that Bedderwick Walker Entertainments would own exclusive publishing rights to the Howe Twins' music.
In return, Albert Howe and his sons were guaranteed a substantial salary payable monthly for a period of one year.
Hand on my heart, l never exploited anyone who didn't want to be exploited.
Then Mr. Couling took them away.
L never thought l'd be in a rock band.
I thought we might get away from the Head and l thought we might go and get a job, but- 
at Christmas and that, we'd always get on some old- Like, well, just generally, we'd always like get on, like- But l-I think- l don't know, we've got something special.
L mean, everyone who's ever been famous has always had something that's special to them, and we've got something special.
ever, ever be - [Man #2] Doing an interview.
with a band and doing this- 
Someone recording an interview with us.
always been, like, sort of a-a dream.
All right, hello, mate.
L just want a kind of a nice, happy vibe, but l'm gonna introduce you to the boys.
Sucking it out, but holding it.
This is- This is amazing stuff really.
Looking at it after all these years.
It was a weird place.
Zak created this- this magical wonderland.
And he had every freak in the world there.
But, of course, the boys were the main attraction.
It was all about them.
going on myself at the time so they were gonna give me a few bucks a week all my expenses, and l was gonna have the opportunity to shoot whatever l wanted to about this- this weird idea.
Perfect.
You can also play it here. Right?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, now hold 'em tight, press 'em down, and just play those three.
You're goin' like this. - Listen to him.
Just play the things that you want.
L am.
It's all right. It's all right.
Most of the chords, you know, you can put them anywhere.
You can write a fucking song with that.
Keep doing that.
Make sure you've got it in your head.
L'm gonna put a song on.
Doot-doot.
Don't argue.
l'm not.!
And listen.
Are you ready?
L want you to listen to this, right?
Then all l have to teach you is to play another couple of chords and you've got the song, mate.
Me and Zak go back to, like, the mid-'60s.
He was always getting me in to babysit the new kids.
Zak wanted singing Siamese twins and he wanted them pop.
The name was his idea, The Bang Bang.
It was my job to sort the boys out musically.
L can't reach. L hurt my fingers.
Well, it's gonna hurt, isn't it?
Get off. You're getting in the way.
You're fucking it up!
We need to get that plectrum now, don't we?
Where have you put it?
Well, Barry threw it.
No, l didn't.
Barry, look, at some point you're gonna have to play it.
See what l'm doing?
You're gonna have to learn this stuff at some point.
No way.
Have a sing, then.
Sing it. Yeah, that's a good idea. Sing it.
Keep going. A- Have a beer.
We'll share it.
Thanks, Paul.
You're welcome.
Keep going. E, A, E.
Drink a bit more and then it'll be in tune.
Maybe that's what we'll do.
We'll string a load of those together.
Bottle solo from Baz.
Ooh, ooh.
Reload.
he give me a call to take me on.
An apprenticeship, he called it.
My future in the entertainment industry.
Ooh, fucking hell, he's there.!
Oh, he's got it. Georgie Best.!
Georgie Best!
That's what they were like.
A real shock.
Fuck it!
He told me, but he didn't tell me, if you know what l mean.
Two-one! Two-one!
Just his henchman, you know?
Unpaid asswipe.
Handling all those freaks was just another shitty gig to me.
Here.
Paul. Paul.
Look, give the other one a guitar, eh?
Give 'em both a guitar. It'll look good.
No, trust me, give 'em one each. Yeah?
Give 'em this one.
There you go.
Here you are, Barry. Barry.
No, it'll look good. Eh?
It's a stupid idea.
Um, let's just start- Let's just- Fucking hell!
to say to me, Barry?
You should turn it off.
It's a fucking joke.
with Barry right from the start, you know.
So l used to hose him down if he got out of control.
No, l'm serious.
You know, with kids and that- You've gotta have a firm hand, ain't ya?
he was always holding something back.
There was always something else going on with him.
L mean, a lot of people's take was he's mischievous, he's a country kid but, no, l think very deep.
L think it was something that ran real deep with him.
It's all gonna end in a couple years.
It doesn't make a difference.
L'd like to be going home.
You ever dream?
Why does he have to come in?
Why?
Well, he's gotta see it, mate.
He's gotta see it.
So l have to- l have to get him in.
But it's fine. You know, all it is, we'll just go through this.
He'll see, uh, you know, how much you've improved.
Look, boys, l mean do it for me, you know, 'cause- 'cause l'll get shit on if-if l'm not seen to be doing my job, so- Let's just bloody do it.
You have to. L can't get around it.
You gotta do it.
And at some point you've gotta do it in front of an audience, so- l mean, you know, Nick's the least of your worries.
spoken about Nick Sidney and how he interacted with Tom and Barry.
Why did you stand by when these kids were getting beaten up?
Fuck off!
Fuck off, Eddie!
What are you fucking still doing here, eh?
What's going on?
The roof.
Oi!
What are you doing up there?
Both of you, down now!
Fuck off!
Do you-Jesus!
Tom, what do you think you're playing at? This is silly.
Eddie, fuck off!
What was that?
Do you wanna be in the band?
Jesus Chr- Little bastard.!
Swear to God, if you don't come down- No, we won't now.!
You will not be in a band.
L will take you home!
Do you want it?
You fucking cunt, you'll be out of a job if you take us home.!
You need us more than we need you.!
What's Zak gonna say then, eh?
Yeah, sure, there was a bad vibe, you know.
Barry was out of control, so what?
Barry delivered when he was under the cosh, yeah?
The treatment l give him worked.
Yeah?
That's you.
that we took the next step.
He called me. He said the boys need a band, and they need an original song.
Their signature, if you like.
The only brief he gave me, he wanted something a bit sexy.
So l thought, okay, well, we've got two Siamese twins- Well, you know, a pair of Siamese twins so l called up Tubs Puller, the ex-Noize drummer.
And l knew this art school kid, Spitz, on guitars.
And l was on bass.
Here we go.
Well, "Two-Way Romeo," if you listen to the lyrics it'll tell you what it's about.
And then the chorus again.
Now don't do that to his hair.
Fuck's sake.
What are you doing? Get off!
What's a matter?
Don't flick cigarettes in my hair.
for the boys to do their first live gig.
He wanted to know up front whether or not to cut his losses.
Ah, we're gonna play down at this, uh, grotty little pub in Stokey.
But it had a great reputation for good new bands.
we had, uh, music three nights a week.
Deejays Wednesdays.
Bands Fridays and Saturdays.
Now they'd rather have a meal.
Yeah, the bands used to just walk through here.
There's a bar along here.
And over there in the corner was the little stage.
Really nasty.
At Humbleden, these guys were protected.
But suddenly they were thrust into this audience.
They were dead nervous.
they're shouting things out at them, things like, uh you know, "Who's these two poofs coming on cuddling each other?" 
Get off. Get off, you queer wankers.!
Everybodyjust froze.
Everyonejust froze.
Out of the blue- l'll never forget this- Barry just grabs the mike stand and starts screaming the lyrics.
L mean, really snarling it out.
L'd never seen anything like that before.
throwing things at them.
And then one of the lads just- he just started kind of taunting the audience back.
Barry's lifting his shirt up.
Tempting them, you know?
Showing them kind of where the join was.
Everyone in that audience thought it was a gag.
Show it, show it, show it!
And then he just rips open his shirt and you just see this incredible, you know band of skin joining them together.
It was like a freak show.
It was like, "Here l am. Fuck you." 
no filming that night.
Just in case they flopped.
Well, they didn't flop.
That was The Bang Bang.
L called Zak straight away.
Zak, you got a band. It's working.
Happy Christmas.
Oi!
That's a special from Mr. Bedderwick, mate.
There's a letter in there as well.
Let's have a look.
Just gently, lads, gently, gently.
something with this.
With great expectations.
Zak Bedderwick." Look, it means a lot to him, that sheet music.
What is it, Tom? Show me.
Every Little Moment.
The Hilton Sisters.
Words and music by BobbyJones.
Featuring the phenomenal success, The Hilton Sisters.
Yeah, they were another Siamese act.
Siamese sisters?
Well, what does he want us to do with it?
You figure it out, boys.
God, right.
Go on then, sing it.
It's not a fucking joke.
Come on.
It sounds like one of our dad's old songs- l don't care what it sounds like.
Change it, do something with it, yeah?
Just- We'll change it. We'll change it.
Whole idea of it was it was Zak's blessing.
It was. It was his blessing.
It was his way of saying "Go ahead, make an album. Go for it. L'll pay for it." L mean, Zak- Zak thought it was just a matter of, you know padding out a couple of catchy hits with a few extra tunes.
Oh, come on!
All right!
Nobody else. L wanted it to be me in the room. It felt like it was.
The boom, boom, bang, bang thing?
Really buzzing from it. Brilliant.
My ears are ringing. L've been so upset.
L didn't care anymore, because- Doesn't matter what you look like, what you dress like.
We're here to dance.
My mum's gonna kill me when she finds out.
When he undid his shirt, we kind of fancied them.
If they can do that, then we can do anything. - That's fucking rocking.
me to get the photo for the album sleeve the record sleeve, you know, and, um- Well, l was going to do this kind of Fontainebleau.
You know, the two women that are holding each other's nipples.
Well, one's holding the other one.
L thought that, you know, with the play, with the twins with the join-with the girls, with the masks.
And then Barry, he took the whole thing completely out of my hands.
The girls didn't know.
L didn't- l just thought l've got to go with this.
Tom was- He was a little studious boy that wanted to be a good musician that wanted to get it right that wanted to please me, and Barry wanted to fuck with me.
Testosterone- 
That's what happened.
That's what l'm talking about.
They're threatening to do an exposé- Muckraking.
They're talking freaks, Henry.
Talking cruel training methods.
that the information in this proposed article comes within any appreciable distance ofbeing accurate?
L know thejournalist. So do you.
Laura Ashworth?
Laura Ashworth?
Laura Ashworth was a slapper, mate.
If you're in trouble and you need a friend Laura Ashworth is the last person you want coming around the corner.
Maybe a cowbell.
Hello.
How are you, sweetheart?
Good to see you.
Look at you.
This is Laura. Laura Ashworth.
Bit old for a groupie, aren't you, darling?
Actually, no, l don't think l am.
Do you?
Yeah.
That's right. You are correct.
L am Tom.
Good to meet you, Tom.
This is George.
L thought it was Barry.
Hi, l'm George.
George. Do you mind if l call you Barry?
Look, he's joking. L'm actually Barry.
Call me Georgina if you want.
L'm Barry. Shake my hand.
Touch my hand.
Hello.
L'm Barry.
Bloody hell.
Same old same old, ain't it?
What is she doing here?
Haven't you been told?
She's gonna write your autobiography.
No, l'm not writing your autobiography.
No, l know you're not.
See you later.
Nick.
What?
So, are you a music journalist then or- 
Well, not quite, but the, um- l'm writing for an academic publication.
gonna be in an academic publication.
Academic publication no less.
So what are you writing about?
Well, you guys specifically.
you're kind of-you know, you're-you're different.
What?
Young and exciting and, you know- What else? Young, exciting- Give me- Give me a third.
Listen, l'm-l'm actually writing an article about exploitation of the physically impaired.
Speak to Tubs. He's got a dodgy ankle.
Of course, l had this image of these two young victims these poor defenseless boys that were being totally exploited.
And then when l see these-these-these-these young, vibrant men with this energy and this presence, and it just threw me totally.
When Mr. Bedderwick approached me with the, um, Laura Ashworth problem l suggested he took her on the payroll.
L knew she wouldn't be able to resist recapturing her past.
And l knew she wouldn't be able to resist the twins.
No- Child psychology.
of other bands and stuff, Laura?
Um, unofficially, yes.
Off the record. On the QT.
No.
Barry- l have to keep him on a lead.
Is that yourjob, between the two of you?
Yes.
Yeah. That's my job.
How do you feel about the people at Humbleden?
Tubs and Spitz?
You like them?
Yeah, well, the- You know, there's lots of - And Mick and Aaron and- Felix.
Ben.
in particular that you, um you get on with more than- Ask him about Adelle.
Adelle.
Just a girl l like.
Just a girl.
Oh, really? Is there interest already?
You wanna ask Tom about that.
No, it's not important.
Am l embarrassing you?
No, don't- 
It's my songbook. It's what l write chords in.
about Adelle? - [Tom] No.
It says you-says you wanna says you wanna have sex with her.
Says you wanna have sex with Adelle.
What? Oh, what?
Tommy does.
Tommy-Tommy wakes up in the night, what, talking about Adelle and that and-and that he wants to- He wants to touch her bum.
No. Shut up.
And-And he fiddles.
Shut up.
Rubs himself up and down at night.
Shut up.
He does. He does.
Shut up. Shut up.
He does. He wakes up in the night- Just shut up.
And l can feel the bed rolling around and l know it's- Just shut up, Barry.
What's that?
He likes to touch himself?
Barry, just shut up.
Just shut up!
Shut up!
Does Tommy likes to touch himself?
Tommy likes to touch himself!
Tommy likes to touch himself!
Just fucking shut up!
Tommy likes to touch himself!
Just shut up!
Tommy fiddles with himself!
Tommy's a bit sensitive today.
Shut up.
He hasn't had his normal morning wank.
Probably heard it all before.
What?
Probably wanked boys off yourself.
Barry.
and take your boots off.
Okay, um- So, can l ask you what- what happened there?
He speaks the truth.
Who does?
Hasn't got a name. He's just there.
What?
Hejust sits there.
Nothing- Nothing's there.
Just- Just sometimes.
L'm just interested to know, um- 
Sieg Heil.! Sieg Heil.!
Sieg Heil.! Sieg Heil.!
In the first series of ugly scuffles 47 left-wing protesters were arrested.
Tension rose still higher as the National Front march, well over 1,000 strong reached the entrance to Red Lion Square.
Their way was blocked by the left-wingers, and both sides were kept apart by the police.
L noticed that Tom was writing stuff down.
He had a lot of ideas.
Um, so l let him-let him, you know, just-just go with it.
L mean, it was like an explosion of stuff.
If you listen to the lyrics of the songs, it was very small.
It was all about really the places they came from.
They always had an edge.
They always had a sense of danger.
Two to one, and one is three.
Are you you, or are you me?
Now you tell me what that's about.
had a secret friend they used to talk to.
L had two myself.
Doola and Dawla.
They lived in my shoes.
L don't know what the boys called theirs.
Bury me.
Kill me.
friend brought all those terrible nightmares.
is we got lots of rubber bands, right?
You got the lyrics there?
As long as we're in together, be all right.
Whoo!
Go, Tommy.
Ah!
Too fucking right.!
One more time!
didn't forget that they were actually physicallyjoined together, because they were two very different people.
L found the way Tom held his silence was attractive.
And Barry was vulnerable and l tapped into that very quickly and, although he made me feel uncomfortable because he was so in your face a lot of the time um, l just wanted to- protect him, really.
They're-They're-They're right through- They're right through these posh girls, hang out, whatever, they've got the education you know- You know, they lead- lead people astray, mate, lead people astray.
It's, um, generally held that conjoined twins should be separated, whenever medically possible, as early as possible.
The Howes were omphalopagus, um, joined at the lower chest as were the original Siamese twins, Chang and Eng Bunker.
Tom and Barry Howes'circulatory system was interconnected.
And in addition, they shared a liver.
An operation to separate the twins would have been accompanied by extraordinary dangers, given the medical knowledge of that time.
Especially as Barry had been born with a congenital heart defect which made him the weaker sibling.
However, l have no doubt that that would have been the correct decision.
Chang and Eng.
They were born in Siam.
And they were like- They could have cut themselves apart.
You got a bread knife, 'cause that's probably better but this is like- like a hot knife through butter, that is.
Bye-bye, Bar. Bye-bye, Barry.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Barry.
Might do. Might not.
Could do.
Could not.
Are you guys gonna have kids?
Don't know.
Are you gonna have a kid?
Huh. Imagine if l had twins.
Imagine if l had triplets.
Imagine if l had quads.
Imagine if l had- Sextuplets.
Five-teplets.
If l had conjoined twins- l would cut 'em down the middle, like a slice of bread.
That's right.!
Um, l think Ken Russell should stick to Women In Love which l think is brilliant.
But like a lot of biopics, you know, um they miss the essence the essential beauty.
What else do you want?
Oh, darling.
Thank you very much.
Oh, Laura.
You're a star.
You're my wonderful woman.
Excuse me.
Adelle?
That's just how l like them.
Something l can dunk my soldiers in, if you know what l mean, Laura.
Do you like dunking your soldiers, Barry?
L love to dunk my soldier.
You love it when l dunk my soldier, don't you, Laura?
Shut up, Barry.
Oh, hard.
Never mind, never mind.
Would you like some toast?
No, just on its own, thanks.
L reckon what we should do just to make this beautiful sunny morning even better- 
Does it look nice?
L love it.
Thank you, Barry.
You look very pretty, Laura. You do.
You look very pretty this morning actually.
What?
Okay.
What, Tommy?
Soldier?
to you # - Play something else, Tom.
Tom.
Tom, try another fuckin' song.
Tom, you've been playing that song for the last fucking half an hour.
It wasn't an ideal situation, and l know that, you know.
And l had my own anger and frustration about it.
L fell in love with Tom.
You can't choose who you fall in love with.
Rock and roll.
it was like he was fighting for his life.
It was like hejust wanted that- to keep going.
L think he was afraid it would stop.
L think the thought of not having that kind of sense of- of power maybe.
A sense of being wanted, being adored.
L think that frightened Barry a lot.
Oh.
Fuck off!
Stop it!
Stop it!
All right, Tom, you're right.
What are you doing?
Get off!
Go!
Get off.
but one time in particular Barry actually threatened Tom with a knife.
And it got very real.
the Howe brothers on a single occasion just once, after one of those, um violent episodes that they were prone to.
And it was here that l discovered something very interesting.
This dark patch.
A... growth of some kind.
Now, Barry's, um, mood swings and restlessness and general paranoia are indicative of amphetamine abuse but those symptoms can also be attributed to a tumor.
There have been cases where one twin is encapsulated in a cyst or tumor inside the other.
It's- It's known as fetus in fetu.
There was a case of a farmer, age 28 who went to the doctor complaining of a stomachache.
He was found to have a 13-pound fetal twin inside his abdomen.
On opening the head of the fetus, two additional fetuses were found in the cranial cavity.
It's conceivable that Barry Howe harbored the rudiments of a third fetus in his cranium.
A lot of people have asked me about- this-this third head on the shoulders of the brothers.
In the novel, l just simply didn't believe it because things don't grow like that.
Whereas, a sort of growth on the- on the back of the neck, these things are medically documented in such cases.
144, take 12.
But l did think it was a wonderful metaphor for their, um- for their genius, if you like.
It was as though it-it contained the essence of their being.
No, no, love. Sorry.
Sorry, sweetheart. Our present.
What do you reckon, Barry?
Tommy wants one.
Shall we let Tommy do a line? You want to do a big one, Tommy?- Tommy, you're gonna be in our club.
Can you do a big one, Tom?
Yeah.
Leave some for me, all right?
Tommy can do a big one.
No. Hold it.
Tommy's doin' a big one.
You're not on it, not even on it.
Get it. Get it. Get it all.
Get it all.
Come here.
Tommy, you naughty boy.
Tommy- 
You want another?
You want a bigger one?
Tommy wants a bigger one.
Wash it down, Tommy. Wash it down.
Tommy's fucked off that his girlfriend isn't here tonight. Aren't ya, Tommy?
What do you reckon?
Says Tommy does not want another one.
Tommy does not want another one.
Barry, what else does he say?
He says it's time for you to go now, Bob.
Says we're sailin' on, so we don't need you anymore.
See ya later.
Bye. We're goin' now.
No more.
That is the last time you will do it.
You remember- 
Sit down for 10 minutes.
No, l'm all right. L just want to get up.
Tommy. Sit down.
L'm all right.
Sit down.
If you stopped and tried to change the world every time you've got the camera turning um, l guess you'd never make a film and maybe you shouldn't.
Maybe you should never be there.
For l know one thing, we should have had a psychiatrist at Humbleden.
You know, if you're going to push all those buttons with people's psyches somebody should be there, qualified to handle it when it gets out of control.
Is there anyone here tonight called William?
William? Is there a William?
You're a fuckin' cunt.
Get off the stage. Off!
Put your arm around me, Barry.
Put your arm around me.
Get the door, Tom.
Get 'round the fucking front.
Get in the back.
Get in the back.
What? Beat it!
Where are you, Tom?
What can you see?
Sand.
Where's Barry gone?
He's whispering in his ear.
He's whispering- 
Who's whispering? Tom?
Is Barry whispering?
Mm-hmm.
Growing out the sand.
What's it saying, Tom?
He's getting out.
He's getting out. Oh- 
Shh. Tom, it's just a bad dream.
Just a bad dream.
There's nothing going on with the band.
Everything is good, Mr. Bedderwick.
Well, you'll see for yourself, won't you? You'll see for yourself.
And when you see for yourself, you'll be very, very happy.
Tom, how's it going?
It's great, Eddie. It's great.
It's really great.
Yeah? What's happening?
Oh, Barry did a monster one, didn't he?
You don't have to answer his questions, Tom.
Tom does one, Barry does one.
Goes in a circle, doesn't it, Barry?
Why do you think Barry eats itself?
Eats itself, don't it, Barry?
What's happening, Baz?
What's happening with you?
Tom does one.
One.
Barry does one.
No!
Barry does one.!
Bang. Bang.
L know as time went on that Tom became less and less happy with his situation, and l know that may have been something to do with me but if it wasn't me, it would have been somebody else, you know, and l think he wanted his freedom.
The emotional and intellectual lives of conjoined twins are entwined in a- in a highly complex way.
There may be a physical separation that is successful, but in my opinion, l think it's very, very difficult to have a successful emotional severance.
Fuck all to do with me.
Stop playing for two minutes.
What's that?
What?
Read it.
It's to Laura.
What?
Right.
Where's Laura?
Where's Laura?
Where is Laura?
Where is Laura?
L don't know.
Paul, what does it say?
Um- It's from some doctor.
"Come in for a consultation" with reference to fucking separating 'em.
To Laura.
L received this letter from Laura Ashworth acting on behalf of the twins.
The gist is they wished to explore the possibility of separation.
L didn't send that letter to Allardyce Stevens.
Who else would have wrote a letter like that?
Who would else, you know, who would have had the connections?
Who would have known them sort of people, you know?
Of course it came from Laura.
Got to, ain't it?
Sort of thing she would have done.
L have serious doubts that both twins would have survived the operation.
As it was, my response went unanswered.
L never heard from them or Laura Ashworth again.
Bedderwick, you know, he went fucking ape shit.!
He said that bitch had to go.
Someone had to shut her up.
L left because Tom didn't ask me to stay, really.
You know, he didn't say anything, he didn't back me up.
He- 
a position to defend myself.
Or l didn't feel l was then, anyway.
Really, l was set up.
Well, if you ask me, l think Tom guessed who sent the letter.
So, are you guys gonna get separated?
Maybe when one of us- What? What?
He says when one of us dies then we both die.
Together.
We go together.
Go together.
Yeah.
Sounds fucking good.
Yeah.
It sounds fucking brilliant.
So let's get the bass right.
Tom was a very cool customer.
But l don't think he knew how angry he was.
l think- l think that he was a walking time bomb.
This is a special night for The Bang Bang.
First, we'd like to welcome the record company people.
And, of course, Mr. Zak Bedderwick.
We're up here, are we? Rita's fine.
She didn't wanna come tonight?
No, no, no, no. Not tonight.
Next time.
Tammy, have a nice evening.
Pleased to meet you.
Hi, how you doing?
A lot of you have been here before.
You have seen 'em many, many a fucking time.
So you know what's coming, don't you?
Who do you want?
Bang Bang!
Who do we fucking want?
So here they are, The Bang Bang.
Is there anyone out there called Zak?
This one's for you, Zak.
What you give, you get back.
That's what we were trying to do.
It was something to do with the future.
And Barry and Tom just took it into a different place.
Just build and build and build, and it was fucking wonderful.
Cry!
Here.
Impossible to see exactly what happened.
L didn't see.
L was, um- l couldn't get to them.
L just- There's the guitar being lifted, right there.
Now where's Barry?
There's a few rumors going around.
Some people said they saw this.
Some people said they saw that, but you can't- 
that Barry had been struck.
Look how anguished Tom is here.
L just think that he snapped.
by then, and Tom was, uh- He was shaking when he come out.
He didn't speak or nothing.
White.
L didn't see the twins.
Nick bundled them off.
Got them back to Humbleden.
All l know is that they were in bad shape.
It's a long time ago, mate.
Long time ago.
to the big house to collect my brothers they were in a terrible state.
And no one could tell me what happened. It was, um- Tom was crying.
In anger.
And fear too.
And Barry just stared.
It's like he wasn't there at all.
Unbury me.
Unbury me.
"You better take us home, Robbie," Tom says.
So l did.
Who's burying me?
l can't- l can't breathe.
Shh.
Can't breathe. L can't breathe.
Can't breathe.
Help me.
Shall we do it, Tommy?
Go on. One, two, three.
You hold the other side.
Go on. L'll close my eyes.
You hold the other side.
Go on, do it.
Hold the other side.
All right.
Ready?
One, two, three.
Ooh.
Oh, look away a minute, look away a minute.
Yeah, l've done it.
Done it.
L just can't be bothered to move.
No.
Can't.
Here's where l found 'em.
They were- They were huddled together.
It was like they were sleeping.
Like when they were little kids.
L'm not sure if Barry had died first, but Tom you could see where he'd tried to sever himself from his brother.
Help me.
Where are you, Tom?
What can you see?
Sand.
Sand.
Where's Barry gone?
Hmm.
He's whispering in his ear.
He's whispering.
Who- Who's whispering, Tom?
He doesn't have a name.
He doesn't- Shh.
Shh. Tom, it's just a bad dream.
It doesn't have a name.

With Ed here, it's no wonder I always bring my flatmates out and that only exacerbates things.
What do you mean?
You guys hardly get on, do you?
No, what does "exacerbate" mean?
It means to make things worse.
Right, right.
Well, I mean, it's not that I don't like David and Di, you know.
Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
It's all right.
And I do want to spend time with you.

You've sold puff.
Yeah, once. At college. To you.
I've known him since primary school.
I like having him around, he's a laugh.
Because he can impersonate an orang-utan?
Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
Leave him alone.
I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion.
Like that time we stayed up all night drinking apple schnapps and playing Tekken 2.
When was that?
Five years ago.

Writing something on a scrap of paper?
Nope.

I ain't doing nothing for him.
Do it for me, then.

What's the plan, then?  Erm, there's been a bit of a a mix-up with the table, babe.
What do you mean?  They're full up.
But... I thought you said it was all OK?  Yeah.
You didn't book it, did you, Shaun?  No.
So... what is the plan, then?  The Winchester?
Hello?  Dianne, can you let me in?
I'm not sure, Shaun.
Oh, come on.
Lizzie doesn't want to see you.
Just open the door!
She doesn't want to see you.
Do you want me to climb up the wall, come through the window? Because I will.
You're not coming in.
OK, see you in a minute.
Don't...  Hi, it's me again.
Can we just talk about this? Let's go out.
To the Winchester?
Do you want to?
No, I don't fucking want to!
It's not the only place in the world.
We'll go to the Shepherd's, they do Thai in there.
I'm going out with David and Di.
Let's go together.
You hang out with my friends?
"A failed actress and a twat"?
That's harsh.
I did not call Dianne a failed actress.
Let's just go somewhere and have a laugh.
Things'll be fine, I promise.
You promised you'd stop smoking.
You promised you'd try drinking red wine instead of beer!
You promised we'd go on holiday.
We went to Greece!
We met in Greece.
At a rave.
It's not the same.
You promised things would change.
You promised us free cable.
I'm working on that.
I can give up smoking whenever I want.
See, don't need them.
W- What was the next one?
It's not enough, Shaun.
'We appear to have a breakdown in communication there.
Lf you or someone you know may...  I'd say your nine lives were up, Shaun.
Get fucked, four-eyes!
You go out with her, you love her so much.
What do you mean by that?
'... the devastation really is extensive.
It's a total mess.' I don't know what he meant by that.
Got you these.
"To a wonderful mum"?
Oooh!
Yeah, that's because I thought it would be funny because of what you said last night about you don't want to be my mum and that.
It's just a little joke, just sort of spur of the moment.
They're for your mum, aren't they?
Yeah.
Smooth.
If I don't do something, I'll end up in that pub for the rest of my life like those other sad old fuckers wondering what the hell happened.
What do you mean do something?
Fuck her. You got your pint.
You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?
Oh. You want your favourite monkey?
Shall I do Clyde?
See, I knew you'd get over her.
Who the hell put this on?
It's on random.
For fuck's sake. John, yes please, mate.
You know what we should do tomorrow?
Keep drinking.
A Bloody Mary first thing, a bite at the King's Head, couple at The Little Princess, stagger back here and bang back at the bar for shots.
How's that for a slice of fried gold?
No.
Come on, man.
Talk to me.
She said if she stayed with me she'd end up in here for the rest of her life like these sad old fuckers wondering what the hell happened.
That is harsh.
These are rich, interesting characters.
Like who?
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.
He's a bigamist.
Strangled his first wife with a draught excluder.
And invented the mobile disco.
What about her, then?
Ooh! Cockacidal maniac.
She's an ex-porn star.
They say she starred in the world's first interracial hardcore loop.
Cafe Au Lait Pour Vous.
Yeah. What about John, then?
He's North London Mafia.
It's true, Big Al says so.
Yeah, Big Al also says dogs can't look up.
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanour.
Bernie, the trophy wife.
He's connected.
Why is there a rifle above the bar?
The pub's called the Winchester.
Exactly.
See, you don't need Liz to have a good time.
Don't, man.
No.
Oi, look at me.
Can I just say one thing? I'm not gonna say there's plenty more fish in the sea, I'm not gonna say if you love her let her go and I'm not gonna bombard you with clichés but what I will say is this it's not the end of the world.
Sorry, we're closed.
Pisshead.
Oh?
What's the matter, love, haven't you had your tea?
telling my body to come along 
Shh!
Blow!
What? He should say base.
Or freeze.
What a tit.
Don't scratch it! Wait That was the second album I ever bought!
It's four in the fucking morning!
It's Saturday!
No, it's not.
It's fucking Sunday and I've got to go to fucking work in four fucking hours because every other fucker is fucking ill!
Now can you see why I'm so fucking angry?
Fuck, yeah!
Hey! Pete, look, I'm sorry, we had a couple of drinks, we split up with Liz tonight.
Just keep it down, yeah?
Prick.
What was that?
Nothing.
Stop it, we're friends!
He's not my friend. He's a fucking idiot.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means why don't you fuck off!
You wanna live like an animal, live in the shed, you thick fuck!
Leave him alone!
Stop defending him.
All he ever does is hold you back.
Or is it easier having someone around who's more of a loser than you?
What's that supposed to mean?
You know what I mean.
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?
Sort your fucking life out, mate.
What's up with your hand, man?
I got mugged on the way home from work.
By who?
Some crackheads. One of them bit me.
Why?
I don't know, I didn't stop to ask them!
I've got a splitting headache and your stupid hip hop isn't helping.
And the front door is open. Again!
It's not hip hop, it's electro. Prick.
Next time I see him, he's dead.
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today 'so can you book the table for eight rather than seven?
I'll try you at work. Bye, bye.
'Hello, pickle. It's me, Mum.
'Dad mentioned you might be visiting tomorrow which would be lovely.
'Will you be bringing Elizabeth with you this time?
'Only we can't wait to meet her finally 'and also I was wondering if she wanted anything special for lunch?
'Cos these days a lot of people don't eat meat.' Do you want anything from the shop?
Cornetto.
Nelson, have you got any papers?
Nelson? I haven't even I owe you about 15p.
Oh dear.
Sorry, I haven't got any change.
I didn't even have enough at the fucking shop. Oh dear.

What are you doing?

She's so drunk.
How much have you had, love?
Oh! I think she likes you.
Shut up.
She wants a cuddle!
I've just come out of a relationship.
Ed, do something!
Wait there.
Ed!
Two seconds.
I'm really flattered and everything but And, hold it there.
Ed! Just get her off me.
Jesus!
What's up with her eyes?
Now, seriously Mary, I'm warning you, I'll have to get physical, I mean it!
This is it... Look, just fuck off!
I think we should go back inside.
Shaun, what's going on?
Shit, it's engaged.
How about an ambulance?
It's engaged, Ed.
Fire engine?
It's one number and it's busy!
And what do you want a fire engine for?
Anything with flashing lights.
Are they still out there?
Yeah. What do you think we should do?
Have a sit-down?

Now what?
Get more stuff.
What's in the shed?
Dunno, it's locked.
Why is it locked?
It's always been locked.
No! That's the second album I ever bought!
Some of these are limited Ah! What was that?
Blue Monday.
That was an original pressing.
For fuck's sake.
Erm... Purple Rain?
No.
Sign O' The Times?
Definitely not.
The Batman soundtrack?
Throw it.
Dire Straits?
Throw it.
Er... Ooh, Stone Roses?
No.
Second Coming?
I like it.
Ah! Sade?
That's Liz's.
She dumped you.
I'm going to the shed.
You said it was locked.
Which one do you want? Girl or bloke?
Er... the first one.
'People receiving bites have experienced headaches and nausea and developed symptoms...  You've got red on you.
'Lf you know someone who has been bitten 'it is absolutely essential that you isolate them immediately.

Pete?
Why don't we just go up?
Don't go up there!
Why not?
Because A, he might be one of them and B, he might still be annoyed.
Pete?
Maybe he went into work.
How come he didn't drive?
His keys are still here.
Maybe he got a lift.
He said he wasn't feeling well. Pete?
Oi, prick!
He's not in.
You got a fag?
No, I've given up.
Since when?
Since Come on, babe. Oh, she's engaged.
That was quick.
Ed, this is serious.
Liz!
Shaun.
Mum! I was gonna call you. Are you OK?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Some men tried to get into the house.
Are they still there?
I'm not sure. We shut the curtains.
Did you try the police?
Well, I thought about it.
Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
No, I'm fine.
Mum?
Well... they were a bit bitey.
Mum, have you been bitten?
No, but Philip has.
Oh, OK.
Has she been bitten?
No, Philip has.
Oh, OK.
Mum, what state is he in?
He's fine. Bit under the weather.
I see.
What's the deal?
We may have to kill my stepdad.
Mum, you're not safe there. I'm coming.
I don't want to cause a fuss.
We're coming to get you, Barbara!
So, what's the plan?
Right.
'We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's, we go in, we take care of Philip.
I'm so sorry, Philip.
'Then we grab Mum, go over to Liz's place, 'hole up, have a cup of tea and wait for all this to blow over.
Why have we got to go to Liz's?
Because we do.
She dumped you.
I have to know if she's all right.
Why?
Because I love her.
All right, gay.
I'm not staying there, though.
Why not?
If we hole up, I want to be somewhere familiar, I wanna know where the exits are and I wanna be allowed to smoke.
'Take Pete's car, go round Mum's, go in, deal with Philip.
Sorry, Philip.
'Grab mum, go to Liz's, pick her up, bring her back here, 'have a cup of tea and wait for all this to blow over.' Perfik.
No, wait, we can't bring them back here.
Why not?
It's not exactly safe, is it?
Yeah. Look at the state of it.
Where's safe? Where's familiar?
Where can I smoke?
Take car, go to Mum's, kill Phil.
Sorry.
'Grab Liz, go to the Winchester, 'have a nice cold pint and wait for all this to blow over.' How's that for a slice of fried gold?
Yeah, boy!
'To recap, it is vital that you stay in your homes.
'Make no attempt to reach loved ones 'and avoid all physical contact with the assailants.' Do you believe everything you hear on TV?
Yeah, I can see it, it's just outside.
Any zombies out there?
Don't say that.
What?
That.
What?
That. The Z word. Don't say it.
Why not?
Because it's ridiculous.
All right. Are there any out there, though?
Can't see any.
Maybe it's not as bad as all that.
Oh! No, there they are.
OK, let's do this, yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah! I got to do a wee first.
Ooh... can I drive?
What?
I always wanted to drive Pete's car.
I might not get another chance.
Ahh! Oh, God.
Sorry, Pete. Listen, we're gonna borrow your car, OK?
Erm, we'll bring it back.
And if you're feeling better later, we're... we're going to the pub.
You're more than welcome to, er join us.
Pete'd be so pissed off if he knew I was driving his car.
I don't think so.
Shaun, which button's central locking?
Oh, cock it!
Get lost!
Drive.
'The Church of England has joined other extremist religious groups 'in proclaiming this "a sign of a coming apocalypse".
'Downing Street is refusing to be drawn into a religious debate.
'The bodies of the recently deceased are returning to life and attacking the living.' Let's put something else on.
What are you doing? Ed, look out!
I think we hit something.
Or someone.
Ow!
Are you all right?
Come on, let's just go.
Hello?
He's gonna be dead either way.
That's not the point.
Oh, thank God for that.
Ah, hello.
Who's a pretty boy then?
You didn't say Barbara had a Jag.
I've always wanted to drive a Jag.
It's Philip's. He won't let anybody near it.
I put a Mars Bar in it once and he chased me with a bit of wood.
Fuck, it's gorgeous.
It seems pretty clear, we should go.
Why don't I stay here?
What, what, what, what, what?
You know, just look after the car.
If there's any problems I'll honk three times.
Don't forget to kill Philip!
Hello, pickle.
Hi, Mum.
You've got red on you.
Yeah. Mum, is everything OK?
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
Where's Philip?
Dad's in the lounge.
He's not my dad.
Really!
Ed's outside, we'll take you somewhere safe.
What about the doctor?
I don't think he's gonna come.
Philip won't want to leave the house.
Philip isn't Put the kettle on and I'll deal with Philip.
OK, then.
You hungry?
Not really.
I'll make some sandwiches.
No fighting, you two.
'... you may ask where is our God?
'But throughout the land, men and women of integrity 'rise up to confront the unseen enemy.
'They will not be cowards, 'they will be courageous in the face of danger.' I'm so sorry, Philip.
Why?
What have you done now?
Nothing.
What have you got there? Flowers, I hope.
No, it's... cricket bat.
Is that for the jumble, Shaun?
No. Yes.
Your toys are upstairs.
I was going to give them to the jumble.
I took them all to the tip, Barbara.
What?
Shaun wants to take us somewhere.
Don't be silly.
Maybe you should stay here and wait for the doctor.
You said he wasn't coming.
You didn't call the doctor?
Just to be on the safe side.
I'm fine. I ran it under a cold tap.
We had ourjabs when we went to the Isle of Wight.
But, Philip It's overblown nonsense.
A lot of drug nuts running wild.
But I should get Mum away.
I'm not going anywhere without Philip.
Mum, look!
How about that tea?
Mum, how much do you love Philip?
Two sugars, is it?
I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.
Oh, yes. Will you cut me some bread, love?
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?
Do we have to go through all that again?
What would you say if I told you that Philip's been quite unkind to me?
You weren't easy to live with.
He chased me with a bit of wood!
You did call him a you-know-what.
Did he tell you that? Motherfucker.
Shaun!
Sorry, Mother... Mum!
Did you know that on several occasions he touched me?
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have, sorry.
You don't understand No, you don't understand.
Philip is my husband and has been for 17 years and I would at least expect you to respect my feelings.
You must be more adult about these things.
Yeah.
Come on, Shaun.
There comes a time when you just gotta be a man.
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.
Hello, Edward.
Hi, Barbara.
My, how you've grown.
You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?
It wasn't as easy as all that.
Are we following you?
No, it's probably best if we Where's the car?
Hmm... I pranged it.
You were parked.
Yeah.
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.
Philip?
What?
Look out!
Christ!
Give me the car keys!
You're not driving that car.
Give me the car keys!
Ed, get Mum in the car.
I'm on it.
Don't worry about me.
Worry about your mother.
Maybe I should drive.
I've adjusted the seat now.
Just be careful!
Can you please turn that noise down?
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?
I'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket.
It is a bit loud.
Sorry, Barbara.
You do realise this is a 20 mile an hour zone?
Oh, yeah.
Here.
Mum, this won't take a second, all right?
Have you still got the child locks on?
Safety first, Shaun.
You can't Hey, man, watch the leather.
Keep moving. If there's any problems I'll do the honks.
Hello?  Hello?
Guys, can you let me in?
What are you doing?
I've come to get you.
What are you doing?
I've come to take you somewhere safe.
We were safe!
You don't know that.
There was two of them out there.
How many are there now?
Lots.
Lots!
It only takes one of them to know you're in here.
I tried calling but I couldn't get through.
I had to come up with a plan.
Oh, you made a plan?
We have to get out of here.
If we don't, they'll tear us to pieces.
And that will exacerbate things for all of us.
Shaun This is not about you and me.
This is about survival.
We need to be somewhere more secure, somewhere we can stay alive.
We're with you, Shaun.
What?
We're with you.
I'm not going out there.
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces and if you think about it, neither do you.
I'm not going if Lizzie's not going.
She's going.
I'm not staying by myself.
You're going, aren't you?
Lizzie?
Liz?
All right, Flash, what's your plan?
Great. I've got a car but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.
Has anyone got transport?
Yes!
Great. Where?
Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.
David?
I don't see the point of owning a car in London.
Look, just get any blunt objects together.
If you get cornered, bash them in the head.
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.
So, what's the plan, then?
We're going to the Winchester.
OK? Let's go.
Come on.
Where's the car?
What's up, niggaz?
Apologies for the cramped conditions.
Di, stay on David's lap.
Philip, hang in there, OK?
Ed, get there fast.
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.
Hello.
Ed, be careful.
Is your dad all right?
He's not my dad.
He's bleeding.
I know! Ed, be careful.
Thought you wanted to get there fast?
I want to get there in one piece!
Why are we going this way?
Chill out, it's a short cut.
That road goes to the Winchester.
Shaun Liz, please!
I don't understand why the Winchester?
It's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.
They know us.
What makes it so secure?
It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.
And there's a rifle above the bar.
I would think that's deactivated.
It's not. John's connected. Big Al says so.
Big Al also says dogs can't look up.
They can't.
Can't they?
Of course they can!
Are you sure?
Yes! The pub is the right place to go.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Shaun I turned it off, all right?
What?
Being a father, it's not easy.
What?
You were 12 when I met you, you'd already grown up so much.
I just wanted you to be strong and not give up because you lost your dad.
Philip, you don't have to explain.
No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.
And I always thought you had it in you to do well.
You just need... m-motivation.
Somebody to look up to and I thought it could be me.
Would you just... take care of your mum?
There's a good boy.
Ed, can you pull over?
Two seconds.
Ah! Ed, please pull over.
What for?
Just pull over!
All right.
Whoa, momma!
What the hell are you doing?
Chill out. Everyone's all right.
Stop telling me to chill out!
And everybody is not all right.
What's wrong?
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.
Where's he gone?
Mum, he's dead.
No, he isn't.
Get out!
Jesus!
Get it open!
Ed, get the child locks!
Quick!
The child lock!
Ed!
Now what?
We keep moving.
How do we get Philip out the car?
We haven't got time.
We can't leave your dad.
He's not my dad!
Mum, he was, but he's not any more.
I really think we could That's not your husband in there. OK?
It looks like him but there is nothing of the man you loved in that car.
Let's go, shall we?
You're not suggesting we walk?
Everybody OK?
Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.
Maybe we should all hold hands, make a crocodile?
Do you know where we're going?
David, come on.
Sorry.
Do you, though?
Yeah, totally.
Are we close?
We're pretty close.
Is your mum gonna be OK?
Yeah, I hope so.
Did you contact your folks?
They're in Antigua.
Do you think this is happening there?
I hope not.
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but You said this wasn't about us.
No, it's not.
You said it was about survival.
It is, but You're notjust trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.
Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
Shaun.
Yvonne.
How's it going?
Er, surviving.
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.
Hey, Yvonne.
Erm... this is my boyfriend, Declan.
Erm... my friends Mark, Maggie, my mum and my cousin Tom.
All right.
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.
They've split up, actually.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
That's a shame.
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?
Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
The pub?
Yeah.
Right, well. Good luck!
Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
All right.
See? The Winchester's just over there.
Over where?
Over there.
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?
What's the matter, David?
Never taken a short cut before?
Shaun.
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.
Now, the Winchester is just over that fence, all right?
Everyone stay where they are, I'll Are we all here?
One, two, three, four, five. Yes.
There's six of us.
Mum!
I'm coming!
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.
Shaun?
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
Shaun!
Yes!
No, that's rubbish.
Ooh!
Yes!
Feel free to step in any time.
You did all right.
I didn't want to cramp your style.
I'm so sorry about that.
Right.
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.
Is it clear?
No.
How many?
Lots.
Oh, well, that is just great.
There are a fair few of them, yes.
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme up his sleeve?
This is hardly constructive, David!
We should have stayed at the flat.
Why didn't you?
Because... Because, because of Captain Wow.
Will you stop it?
We'll get nowhere moaning.
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.
Or not.
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face, it's vacant with a hint of sadness.
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.
D-Daffs.
Uh.
Come on!
Urgh.
It's mournful, sorrowful, you're dead and you hate it. Go.
Uuurgh.
Much better. Ed.
I'll do it on the night.
This is the night!
What is that?
What about yours?
Who died and made you fucking king of the zombies?
Don't Yeah, that's pretty good.
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
One, two, three.
Go, go, go, go.
Shit! Get round me, get round me!
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.
They can hear you.
We do the quiz.
They know.
Stay in character!
I can't see them.
Shaun, we have to get inside.
Break the window.
We'll be exposed!
Break the window!
Is there another way in?
Yeah, there's Two seconds. Hey, Noodle.
All right?  Yeah, man, I can't talk now.
You get anything yet?  I got nothing.
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.
Oi! What are you doing?
What are you doing? You stupid moron.
Fuck off.
You fuck off!
Fuck fucking off! I've spent an entire life Look at me. I've spent my entire life sticking up for you and all you ever do is fuck things up and make me look stupid.
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!
Shaun.
Oh.
You were saying about another way in?
Yeah, there's a What are you doing?
No!
Get inside.
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.
What do you mean do something?
Hello, hello, over here!
Come on, that's it.
Come on, that's it, over here!
Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.
Wait till I've gone then get inside.
Gone where?
I won't be long, I promise. Come on, you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.
Come on, this way, that's it!
Come on. This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.
Come and get it. It's a running buffet.
All you can eat!
Shall we go in, then?
Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
I think they're for me.
He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
Either way, we need to think about blocking up this window. We're totally exposed.
How will Shaun get back in?
I'm sure he'll knock.
Let's get some lights on.
David, wait!
Power's off.
That's a good thing.
We mustn't advertise our whereabouts.
No, of course not.
Do we, David?
No, of course not, Lizzie.
I'm just being proactive.
There's no lights, no power.
And there's a hole in the window.
You did that, you twat.
Somebody had to do something!
We were in a spot of bother. Somebody has to take control of the situation and if none of you are prepared to accept that responsibility then perhaps... I should.
Will Shaun be gone long?
He'll be back soon.
How do you know?
I don't think he'd leave us.
Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man you binned for being unreliable?
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot is also an impenetrable fortress.
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?
I could get a round in.
Let's just wait for Shaun. We'll barricade the window when he gets back.
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?
What are we going to eat?
Toasties!
There's a Breville out back.
Great. Saved by nibbles.
Must be why Shaun took us here before he left.
He's coming back!
Why? Because he promised?
If he does, do you think his master plan will be anything more than eating peanuts?
Is he just gonna stroll in and suddenly everything's OK?
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.
But what I do know is that we're here now and we have to make the best of it.
Ed, get me a double vodka.
Right you are.
I'll have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?
Hello.
Right, great, fuck it.
We'll have a party and get completely smashed.
We've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars.
David!
We got Twiglets. Oh, look, hog lumps.
Pickle!
Hello, Mum. You all right?
Everybody OK?
Yeah.
Any sign of John and Bernie?
No.
Check upstairs?
It's locked.
Phones?
Dead. Same as the power.
Nice of you to join us.
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't I?
How did you lose them?
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn't difficult. They're not all that.
Well, how did you get in?
The back door.
I tried to tell you before you smashed the window.
But it wasn't me blowing our cover by arguing with my boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.
Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.
Thanks, babe.
So, what's the plan, then?
Would anyone like a peanut?
Why don't you do your Clyde?
Has anyone seen Every Which Way But Loose?
Ed does the most amazing impression of the orang-utan.
No, it's not.
It is. Come on. Do it.
No, no.
But it's brilliant. Come on.
You've built it up too much.
No, just do it.
Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Come on, do it.
I'm not a performing monkey.
The power's on.
It's not, I tried it earlier.
The streetlights are on.
I'll flip the fuses, we can watch television.
What about the lights?
Yes. Don't advertise our whereabouts.
The lights are on a separate circuit.
Just flip the mains breakers.
It's quite simple, David.
Is that it?
That's it.
Liz, erm... have you got a quid?
Erm Yeah.
Never anything on, is there?
What?
I think we might have a bit of a problem.
What do you mean?
They followed me.
I thought you said you gave them the slip.
Yeah.
Well, we'll just have to be extra quiet then, won't we?
What?
Ed, no!
Turn it off!
Shit!
Where the hell did he come from?
I dunno.
Who put this on?
It's on random.
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.
What?!
The jukebox!
Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
What about the rifle?
Cocktails?
What do you mean?
The flaming spirits Get a rag in, light it.
But the whole place could go up.
What, then?
How about pool?
John, it's time at the bar.
leaping through the sky like a tiger 
like Lady Godiva 
I can't find the switches!
Then get the fuses!
a supersonic man out of you 
cos I'm having a good time 
I don't wanna stop at all 
Why is Queen still on?
We have a situation!
I know!
Fuck this. Two seconds.
Ed!
Oi!
Shaun!
No!
Yes! Yes! In the head!
Ooow!
Shauny!
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
good time, good time 
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?
Ed, for the last time, it's I fucking knew it!
What did I tell you? Big Al was right.
But dogs can look up.
Has anyone fired a gun before?
Oh, yeah.
Apart from Ed?
I'm a pacifist.
Apart from David and Ed?
What was Ed's experience?
He shot his sister in the leg.
I think you should do it.
We should all do it.
How can five people operate one gun?
No one has any experience. We've got 29 bullets.
Call them shells.
29 shells. I need someone to help me reload, everyone else to look out. I will fire.
As Bertrand Russell said the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation.
I think we can all appreciate that now.
Was that on a beer mat?
Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.
I won't say anything.
Thanks.
They want to come in.
Get Mum out of the way.
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.
Barbara.
Oh, hello.
Would you like to come with me?
That'd be lovely.
It's nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun's always talking about you.
Really?
Yeah.
Ah!
Barbara?
Are you all right?
I've got something for you.
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.
I'd like you to have it.
Barbara, Shaun and I have It seems only right.
I didn't want to say anything.
I thought Shaun would be worried.
Liz!
Here they come!
Stay behind me!
There's one!
Sorry, we're closed!
The safety!
That happened to me on stage.
Cock it!
There!
Where?
Three o'clock!
Oh! Over there again. Quarter to twelve.
What?
Keep it simple!
Top left!
Reload.
I'm on it!
Come on, come on.
Nice shot.
OK, David, Dianne, let's block up this window!
Ed, take over a sec.
What is it? What's wrong?
Shaun, I'm so sorry.
Mum, what's wrong?
I didn't want to be a bother.
Mum, what's wrong?
I didn't want to be a bother.
Mum, I don't understand.
The man in his pyjamas.
I didn't want to say anything, I thought you'd be upset.
No, you should've said.
Take over a sec.
What's going on?
What's up?
What the hell's going on?
Barbara's hurt!
Just take over a minute.
Jesus.
I know first aid.
Just hang on. Mum!
Mum.
Is she...?
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.
I never thanked you.
For what?
For these. "To a wonderful mum." It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
Oh, no, no! Mum, come on.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Mum. Please don't go.
What are you doing?
We have to deal with her.
Daffs!
For Christ's sake!
She's gonna come back!
She's not going anywhere.
She'll change.
She's my mum!
She's a zombie.
Don't say that.
Move aside. I'm gonna count to three.
One two three!
Don't point that gun at my mum!
Calm down.
Don't point that gun at Barbara!
Ed, don't exacerbate things!
What's that mean?
This isn't exactly fair.
Here.
Thank you.
It's OK.
Please, can we just stop and think about this?
Tell him to put the gun down!
She's gonna change. You know I'm right.
And when she does, she'll kill all of us.
That's what your ex can't seem to realise.
That's what this is about, isn't it?
He doesn't like me!
He's always hated me and now he wants to shoot my mum.
She's not You've never thought I was good enough.
What?
We all know you're in love with Liz.
That is not true.
Yes it is!
That is not true.
Yes it is.
What?
I know you only hung out with me to get close to Liz and when she knocked you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.
I've come to terms with that, Daffs, why can't you?
Lizzie, I want you to know that my feelings for you David! There are slightly more pressing matters at hand here.
Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".
Christ, she's not dead!
She's finished.
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite.
You've gone from a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.
I'm not a chartered accountant.
Well, you look like one.
Yeah.
I'm a lecturer.
You're a twat.
She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.
Don't say that.
We're not using the Z word.
Please can we just calm the fuck down!
Now, I can see what David is trying to say Thank you.
Even if he is being a twat.
Yep.
And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.
I can't begin to imagine how hard this must be for you but we can't afford to fall apart.
Shaun, babe I know you don't wanna hear this You do it.
I'm sorry, Mum.
Do it!
Well... I think we're all agreed, you did the right thing there.
David, no!
David!
Right, I'm leaving.
What?
I'm not staying here.
David, it's suicide.
I think you should go.
We will. We can defend ourselves.
What do you mean "we"?
What do you mean?
Opening that door now would be a very silly thing to do.
You gonna stay here with him?
Look After where he led us?
Let me finish!
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.
Get away from that door this instant!
But David!
I'm so sorry, Dianne.
Maybe I'm not the one you should be apologising to.
Shaun David! No!
No! No! No!
David!
No! No!
David!
David!
Dianne, no!
I'm coming, David!
David!
Oh dear.
Cocktails?
Do it.
Stay back!
Shaun, hold them!
Heads!
Ed!
Hurry up!
Shauny, look who it is.
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
Ed!
Shaun!
Ed!
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!
I can't hold them!
No!
Shaun!
Pete!
I said leave him alone!
Ed. Ed!
Shaun, bar!
Ed!
Ed!
Ed!
What?
Chuck us a cloth, will you?
Where are the shells?
They're on the bar.
Oh, fuck.
Ow!
Fuck it!
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?
The cellar.
Maybe we can get out!
There's a hatch out on to the street.
You mean go back outside?
Oh, give us a fucking break!
Go!
I can see the street.
Come on.
Come on!
Why won't it open?
That's it then, we're trapped.
Hey, let's go to the Winchester!
Whose fucking idea was that?
Man, I've really ballsed this up.
No, you haven't.
I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.
I couldn't save Di or David.
I couldn't even save Mum. I'm useless.
You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried.
You did something, that's what counts.
Yeah, I suppose.
Do you think they'll get through?
Yeah.
How many shells have we got left?
Erm... two.
I suppose we could take a few of them out if they stand in a line.
I wasn't thinking about them.
I know.
What about Ed? There's only two shells.
I don't mind being eaten.
How are we gonna do this?
I don't know. Erm One of us has to go first.
One should do the other and then do themselves.
You should do me.
I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.
I don't think I've got it in me to shoot my flatmate, my mum and my girlfriend all in the same evening.
What makes you think I've taken you back?
Well you don't want to die single, do you?
Actually... I would like to be shot.
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag since yesterday, I promise.
He hasn't.
Maybe we should have one now.
You left them in my flat.
Yeah, in the bin.
I was desperate.
Sneaky monkey.
Sorry.
I won't say anything.
Come on, we're getting out of here.
I mightjust stay here.
But we can get out.
You two should make a go of it.
What are you talking about?
I only hold you back.
Yeah, but Maybe you should have this.
Don't you want it?
No.
I can't hit anything with it anyway, I'm rubbish.
Ed, I'm sorry.
What for?
Cos I was shouting at you earlier on.
It's all right.
I'm sorry too.
It's OK.
No I'm sorry, Shaun.
Oh, God! That's not funny.
I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
I'm not laughing.
You'd better be off.
Bye, Ed. Love you.
Cheers.
I love you too, man.
Gay.
Ready?
Ready.
Section One. Ready.
Zombies to your front. Fire!
Fire!
Oh, my God! Shaun!
Yvonne?
How are you doing?
Surviving.
They're taking us somewhere safe.
I thought you two might want to tag along.
Is itjust the two of you?
Well, glad somebody made it.
Come on.

What the hell was that?
What?
Hey!
You talking to my girl?
Oh, shit. Here we go.
Yeah.
She was just admiring my ride.
My ride.  My grandma's Buick could smoke that piece of shit, trailer trash.
Well, what about your daddy's Viper?
This beast's got 500 horsepower and a Borla exhaust system.
It does 0 to 60 in like 4.3 seconds That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.
Wow.
You can read the brochure.
What a pitch, baby.
What a pitch. I like that.
What's he gonna do?
Let's make it happen.
Bring it.
I got your I got your back.
Why don't you nice boys let your cars do the talking?

Winner gets me.

What the hell?
Guess I got a new date for prom.
Clay, stop the car!
Shut up!
Clay, stop the car!
Shut up!
Stop it!
Clay, please stop!
Please stop!
Can I get a copy of that?
You think this is a joke, huh?
You see Ken and Barbie over there?
They're gonna walk out of here without even a slap on the wrist.
Mommy and Daddy are too hooked up.
But I like screw-ups like you.
You know why?
'Cause you're 100% guaranteed conviction.
Where's my car?
I crushed it.
You did what?
Sit down! You're done.
Easy, easy.
You're done. You understand me? You're done.
And all before your eighteenth birthday. Now sit down.
Sean.
What the hell were you thinkin', huh?
Mrs. Boswell? Please.
It's, uh, it's Miss.
Officer, is it, um, illegal to smoke in here?
It's a tough state.
And it's a pretty clear-cut case.
He'll be lucky if they don't try him as an adult.
This is our third town in two years.
Your son's got two priors for reckless driving, willful destruction of property.
This makes it strike three.
They're definitely gonna want to get him off the streets.
Well, there's just got to be another way.
So, where are we moving this time?
We are not moving anywhere.
Sean.
I thought you were gonna be here on the 7th.
Today is the 7th.
Well, look, just hold on one second.
Come on in.
This is it.
You know, Sean, I was, I was gonna be there.
But your mom, she said the 7th, see, and we're a day ahead of you in Japan.
Well, you're here now, and that's good.
So, how is your mom?
Where do I sleep?
Now, Sean, you know she had no other choice.
I mean, it was either this or juvie hall, I mean, you just can't keep moving away every time you get into trouble.
Worked for you.
Look, neither of us asked for this.
But I promised your mom I'd take care of you.
So you just go by the rules her and I agreed to, and I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
Rules?
Yeah, rules. Real simple.
You go to school, you come back here right after.
And I don't want to see or hear about you anywhere near a car.
Here, the bedroom is yours.
Make yourself comfortable.
Lights out in 10.
You got to be kiddin'.
Wrong train.
I'm new here.
Boswell, yes, ma'am.
Japanese food is like the Army.
Don't ask, don't tell.
Name's Twinkie.
Hey, I noticed you ain't have a laptop.
Yeah?
I'll hook you up.
Half price.
No, I'm cool.
60% off. Hmm?
Since we're both army brats and everything.
I ain't got no cash, man.
And I ain't an army brat.
All right, all right.
Well, what about a cell phone, huh?
Everybody needs a cell phone.
No offense, but I'm probably not gonna be here long enough to remember your name.
Then you gonna need some new shoes to book town with, man.
You like Michael Jordan?
I love Michael Jordan.
Check this out.
Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.
LeBron James couldn't even get his hands on those.
You selling that Sparco steering wheel?
Hell, no.
That's mine right there.
Man, I even paid retail for it.
What you drive?
My ride?
Yeah.
My ride's one of a kind.
Show me.
Thought you weren't stickin' around.
All right.
My life be like Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh My life be like Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh My life be like Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh My life be like It's times like these that make me say Lord if you see me please come my way Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid Feel me like a fingertip Slamming, huh?
Look at that car.
Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do At least let me drive.
Y'all better have some real cars around here.
Okay, I see somebody got jokes, huh?
Well, all right.
I don't know if you're ready for them, though.
You look a little nervous.
What up, Tosh?
I wonder if you know How they live in Tokyo If you see me then you mean it Then you know you have to go Tick, Tick, Tick I wonder if you know How they live in Tokyo If you see me then you mean it Then you know you have to go For when you blow your wad, man.
Tick, Tick, Tick Hear that?
It's still not right for the way I drive.
I don't need a computer to tell me about my throttle response.
Okay.
Then we're done here.
You wouldn't have that problem with a V8.
Boys.
All they care about is who's got the biggest engine.
I'm a guy.
It's in my DNA.
So y'all race with these things, huh?
Cute little toys.
You know, I almost didn't recognize you without your slippers on.
Don't you mean uwabaki?
Neela, right?
You're a quick learner.
So, where you from, anyway?
Here.
No, I mean, not where you live.
Where'd you come from?
Does it really matter where I'm from?
Who's the tourist?
What's with you and the schoolgirls, D?
You're moving up in the world.
You gotta elevate your company.
Wednesday, Wednesday, meet Thursday.
God. Girl.
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?
All right, beautiful.
Hold up.
Hey!
He was just leaving.
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.
Understand that?
Gaijin?
Takashi.
We were just talking.
This isn't your scene.
That word you called me, gaijin or something or other, what does that mean exactly?
Means, turn around, keep walking.
That's exactly what we gonna do.
Come on, man, let's roll.
Yo, look, man, he's yakuza.
Now, see, that's funny, 'cause I thought this was, like, a free country where a girl could talk to whoever she wants.
You know who I am, boy?
Yeah. You're like the Justin Timberlake of Japan, right?
Leave.
Damn, man.
You know yakuza? The Mafia?
Look, sorry, DK- san.
Monkey didn't have his banana today.
Hey, D, let's go.
It's time to race.
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.
You're the one that's lucky, 'cause I'm about to race.
Then let's race.
With what, huh?
Your skateboard?
Easy to sound cocky when you got no ride.
Take mine.
Let's race.
What? I wanna see what the kid's got.
Can he drive?
Can he drive?
You know what DK stands for?
Donkey Kong?
Drift King.
Drift?
What do you mean, drift?
Still need a dictionary?
You know that real famous painting?
The one of the woman who's smiling all the time?
The Mona Lisa.
Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.
Well, look, man, this car right here's like the Mona Lisa of the drift world.
Han rebuilt this bad boy from ground up.
We talking forged pistons, bigger turbo, new rods, new crankshaft.
Hey, man, Han's labor ain't cheap, man, you feel me?
Well, if I needed a 30-second lesson on how to drift All right, look, man, there's lots of ways you can do this, all right?
Hand braking is the easiest, so the first thing I want you to do, I want you to rip that e-brake.
All right, after you rip the e-brake, then I want you to power over.
You know what?
Just don't mess up Mona, all right?
All right.
Ready.
Set.
Go!
I told you.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Don't leave town.
Do you know what time it is?
I thought it was around 7:00.
You know, US is a few hours behind.
Looks like the party was better here, anyway.
Have you been racing, Sean?
You're out of here.
Go ahead.
You don't get it, do you?
You have nowhere else to go.
If it doesn't work out here, you're going to jail.
Do you get that?
This isn't a game.
And I'm gonna tell you one more time, if you're gonna live under my roof, you're gonna go by my rules or get out.
Understand?
Understand?
Yes, sir.
Get in.
I'll get you your money.
Why you talking like you have a choice?
There's a guy in there with a paw that owes me some money.
A paw?
Go get me my money.
Okay.
Han said, okane.
Han said, okane.
Let's go.
You're in the pickup and delivery business now.
I might call you once a week or once an hour.
I don't care if you're sick as a dog or in bed with Beyoncé.
I call, you show.
Only if you teach me how to drift.
This ain't a negotiation.
I wasn't negotiating.
What's he doing here?
He's paying me back for that crumpled beer can sitting in my garage.
Hope he's not driving.
Gaijin.
When is your next race?
I'd really like to be there.
Why not be in it?
You heard me.
Ready to lose another car, Han?
I'm ready to take that '86 Corolla off your hands.
All right.
Put up the '72 Skyline.
Done.
What do you think, Morimoto, huh?
Get him out of here.
We have business to discuss.
Your shipment's late.
Since when are you so worried about the details?
When is the shipment arriving, Han?
Just sit pretty and let me handle it.
Hey, Dad, it's me.
Uh, I had to stay after school for some extracurricular activities.
So I'll be home a little later.
Sir.
You really need to stop following me around.
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd stop by and ask your boyfriend for some drifting lessons.
Trust me.
You don't wanna be a part of this world.
It's good enough for you.
You don't know anything about me.
Well, why don't you think I know?
'Cause I'm a gaijin?
An outsider?
Let me guess.
You're an army brat who moved around a lot.
Your mama and daddy was never home.
So you walked around pissed off all the time.
And now you found your family with these drift nuts.
Zero for one, cowboy.
Why can't you go find a nice Japanese girl like the rest of the white guys around here?
Mamacita, oh my God, I think your on fire Do you want me to get you water Is everything okay back there?
I can handle DK.
I thought he's yakuza.
His uncle's yakuza.
He's just playing gangster in his little storage room.
But I need him.
He keeps Uncle Kamata from poking around too much.
What do you mean?
Well, his uncle gets a piece of the action from everyone on his turf.
We're on his turf.
50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.
So have you raced DK?
Why not? Is he that good?
What's the point of a race?
To see if I'm better than the other guy.
Just proves you're faster, that's all.
If I were to race, it would have to be for something important.
Or why else do it at all?
Why are you letting me race?
'Cause you're DK's kryptonite.
And you owe me a car.
She wanna break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down She want some reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton She wanna break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down She want some reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton Oh, shit.
I make ya smile right What the Police cars here are only factory-tuned.
You can do better than 180 k, they can't catch you, so they don't even try.
'Cause its just nice you lookin different sayin' to yourself You know what?
I'm beginning to like this country already.
When my chain keep linkin' like Christmas lights Mamacita, oh my God I think your on fire Do you want me to get you water Danny!
You're looking good.

Disneyland for grownups, huh?
All these girls, man, they look like What, models?
Check it out.
See, Tokyo is the fashion capital on this side of the planet, all right?
Now, imagine you been posing all day.
I mean, that's a lot of hard work.
Not only do you get tired, but, on top of that, you wanna have a little fun, but you can't 'cause you don't even know nobody in town.
And most of the guys around here are too chicken shit to even try picking up one.
So what do you do?
Man, you talk to the little dude who makes you laugh.
Yeah.
Look, man, I don't just think outside the box.
I tear it up.
That's my thing.
Yo.
You should slow it down papi You sound like a carbon copy Sean!
But you're just plain sloppy Hey Mami, you sexy It's dipset Bitch There it go Baby don't stop now There you go Damn shorty look good And I'm thinkin' about gettin' at her Okay, time to whistle at her Ay girl, you make my whistle blow There it go Bring it here baby There it go Bring it here baby Top down and I'm at it again It's hot now and I'm at it to win You heard me Who want it with me Nobody wanna it with me Oh, I'm so fly Oh, Mami, Back up Move it till you feel something hard on your back The red Evo's yours.

You're representing me now.
What you think, I'm gonna let you roll in a Hyundai?
So, girl, let me see you get low Oh, man.
Damn it.
My mother, she's blind in one eye and she can drift better than that.
Han, where did you find this guy?
Will someone please teach this guy how to drift?
Is that yours?
Sure is.
What happened?
I don't know. I found it this way at the base.
It's got potential.
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.
You know, Sean, the Japanese have a saying.
"The nail that sticks out gets hammered." You're gonna be late.
Sean!
Come on, man, you broke it.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
There must be a misunderstanding.
Out of my way, or you're next.
Take it easy.
Look, man, I don't do refunds, all right?
Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!
Touch me again Here.
Try not to break this one.
Say, man!
What the hell is wrong with you, huh?
Now everybody's gonna want exchanges around here.
Damn!
Not easy saving the day, is it?
Maybe you could give me some pointers sometime.
You're doing all right.
Thanks.
Hey.
Yeah?
Sorry about the other night.
Your life isn't any of my business.
It's okay.
Foul!
Ain't no damn foul.
That was a foul.
Yo, you in my face.
That was a foul.
Hey, Han, sort this wanker out.
A wanker?
What do I look like, a zebra?
So, how did you end up over here, anyway?
Well, you know those old Westerns where the cowboys make a run for the border?
This is my Mexico.
Why'd you let me race with your car?
You knew I was gonna wreck it.
Why not?
'Cause it's a lot of money.
I have money.
It's trust and character I need around me.
You know, who you choose to be around you lets you know who you are.
And one car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of, that's a price I can live with.
Look at all those people down there.
They follow the rules, for what?
They're letting fear lead them.
What happens if they don't?
Life's simple.
You make choices and you don't look back.
So, if you don't drift to win, what do you drift for?
You really want to know?
Yeah.
Okay. Let's go.
There's no "wax on, wax off" with drifting.
Learn by doin' it.
The first drifters invented drifting out here in the mountains by feeling it.
So feel it.
Again!
What's in this bag?
You'll see.
How much you got?
Keep going, keep going.
I'm so good, man, I could sell rubbers to a monk.
Again.
Again.
Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.
Go, go, go, go!
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!
Hey, Han.
Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.
Pleasure doing business.
Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?
It's actually not bad.
I didn't even have to put ketchup on it.
See, I'm not a total gaijin.
I hate that word.
It's what they used to call me when I was a kid.
I thought you were born here.
Well, "outsider" can mean many different things.
My mom died when I was 10.
She came out here from Australia when she finished high school.
And all I know about her is that she went to work in a hostess bar.
DK's grandmother took me in.
Well, my parents split up when I was three.
Me and Mom moved around a lot.
Mostly 'cause of me.
Well, it was all 'cause of me.
Kind of made myself an outsider, you know, without even thinking about it.
But I realize now, outsider or insider, it doesn't really matter.
All that matters is knowing what you really want and going after it.
We used to come up here when we were kids.
Even before we could drive we'd cut class, sneak out, come up here, and watch the older kids drift.
Things were different back then.
Once I got my license, I practically lived up here.
Back then, kids just drove whatever they had.
You know, we just made do.
No one bothered us.
The day I got my license is the day I got my first speeding ticket.
The day after that, I won my first race.
I beat this rich kid by three lengths.
I gotta admit, it felt good.
It felt like Like everything else just disappears.
No past and no future.
No problems.
Just the moment.
Boy needs to chill.
Hey, Twink, I'm gonna grab another set.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Another set?
No. Look, that was your third set today.
I mean, them tires ain't cheap.
DK, grab a chair.
We're about to roast some marshmallows.
Yo, come on, man, look Stay away from her, or the only thing you'll be driving is a wheelchair.
Find yourself a new driver.
I'm all right.
What'd you expect?
You didn't just play with fire, you soaked the matches in gasoline.
It's over.
All this over a gaijin?
I am a gaijin.
You've changed, DK.
You say I've changed.
But we're not so different, you and I.
We're both products of fuckups, aren't we?
They say your mom was the best trick in all of Kabukicho back in the day.
Leave my mother out of this.
If we hadn't taken you in, you'd be just like her, doing anything for a buck.
Think anyone would take a second look at you if it wasn't for your uncle?
We're the same, Neela.
Difference is I know who I am and where I belong.
Do you know who you are?
Do you know where you belong?
Hey.
Come on.
Hey, brother.
I vouched for you!
Put my reputation on the line for you!
We were partners!
You think you can keep your side deals from me?
Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.
This is what we do.
Takashi!
What about now? Hmm?
Is this what we do?
Man, you need me.
You'd still be shaking down teahouses for chump change if it wasn't for me.
Get in!
Go! Go! Go!
Come on.
Sean. Sean!
Takashi.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Okay.
I'll go with you.
Neela.
See you when Daddy's not around.
I'm putting you on a plane tonight.
Dad Sean, don't argue with me.
I did this.
I can't run away.
I can't.
Sean, I'm your father.
I'm responsible for your well-being.
And I'm responsible for my mess.
I gotta do this.
Can you understand that?
At least you're not redoing my mistakes.
You all right, man?
We're leaving town.
Look, I know some people I can't do it, Twink.
Look, DK wants your head.
All right?
And the trouble you just made for Kamata?
You're done here, bro.
Maybe I should talk to Kamata.
What?
DK answers to him.
I know I just didn't hear that.
I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
What, are you crazy, huh?
Han is dead, all right!
Plus, you can't just walk into Kamata's place, man!
It's all I got.
Something I think Han would've wanted you to have.
What's this?
You're gonna need it if you're gonna make it out of Kamata's place alive.
Don't you need it?
No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.
Sean.
You need to leave.
You came to the wrong place.
I didn't come here to see you.
Takashi.
You think you can walk in here, dump some cash and walk out?
I know I'm only returning what belonged to you in the first place, sir.
But that's not why I really came.
I came here to apologize.
I know your nephew and I have embarrassed ourselves badly.
Sir, I'm here to offer you a peaceful solution.
How do you plan to accomplish that?
A race.
DK and I have caused nothing but problems for you, for us.
And I'm asking you to allow us to settle this, once and for all.
We race and the loser leaves town for good.
I've already beat this piece of shit once!
Good.
Then it should be easy.
The cops took all the cars.
Hey!
That's why she's spitting.
We almost there, Twink.
Couple more tweaks.
It's not the car I'm worried about, man.
DK picked this road for a reason.
This is his mountain.
He's the only one to ever make it to the bottom.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Come on.
Yeah! Come on!
Come on, Sean.
Let's go! Let's go!
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.
Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.
Yeah, baby!
That's what I'm talking about, man.
I told you!
I wonder if you know How they live in Tokyo If you see me then you mean it Then you know you have to go Fast and furious Tick, Tick, Tick Fast and furious Tick, Tick, Tick Hey, yo, Sean!
Yo, Sean!
Hey, check this out, man.
This dude over here wanna race the new DK.
Heard he's been beating everybody around Asia, too.
Not tonight, Twinkie.
Said he knew Han.
Said Han was family.
All right.
Let's race.
Nice ride.
I won it from my friend Han, a few years ago.
I didn't know he was into American muscle.
He was when he was rolling with me.
You know this ain't no 10-second race.
I got nothing but time.
You ready, kid?
Come on, Sean! Come on!
Ready!
Set!
Go!
You so crazy, you so crazy Far East to West Mic Check Cho large So hot so hard We cho large!
You so crazy, you so crazy So hot so hard We cho large!
You so crazy, you so crazy We got big jewels, big cars Big watch with a pair of Bapesta's Ice cream with an astronaut You don't understand mammy We cho large This that bape shit Shake it like you ape shit



Here's a great one.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
No, but look at me, all tan.
Why don't you get portraits done by a professional photographer?
That's a great idea. I bet they have one of those wind machines.
Yeah, that's great. Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Chandler, what do you say?
All right, but I'm not going.
"I'm" going.
The One With The Engagement Picture English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Dude, that reverse lay-up.
And how about those three-pointers?
Amazing.
And those guys were this close to letting us play this time too.
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
You call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him "Hums While He Pees." Yes, and we call Ross Lingers in the Bathroom.  Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees" just asked me out.
I thought that guy was married.
He's getting divorced.
Ross, maybe you know him.
It's not a club.
If he's getting a divorce, is it a good idea to date him?
Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
That's on the napkins at the club.
I gotta go to work.
You don't have to go for a half-hour.
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups in the office during lunch.
I could just spread him on a cracker.
Rach, why would you hire this guy?
You know you can't date him, right?
I know that.
We joked that we spend so much time together he should call me his "work-wife." Soon he'll be able to call you "that lady he knew that got fired." I won't get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
You wouldn't mind if he was dating someone?
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Dude, that's so sad.
I could put a basketball court in the back.
Could I play?
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?
I just did them.
Well, drop and give me 10 more.
What?
I had a drink with lunch.
Did those cost reports come in?
I did them last night.
Could you make me 4 copies?
Sure.
Great, thank you.
Huh.
Oh.
Hey, Rachel.
Hi, Melissa. What's up?
I'm just about to go out to the store.
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.
Dried fruit and granola, and stuff like that.
What's up?
Is Tag here?
No. Why?
I was gonna talk to him about tonight.
Really? You got a little crush on Tag there, do ya?
We've been flirting back and forth but I was hoping tonight it would turn into something a little more.
Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.
But you know, I remember him saying that he had plans tonight.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
All right, back to work.
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?
I don't want to be known as the office bitch, but I'll call your supervisor.
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.
Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Okay.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
No, I am.
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Yeah.
Maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else.
Try looking sexy.
Okay.
Or not.
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?
I got an audition down the street, and I spilled sauce on my shirt.
You got an extra one?
Yeah, sure.
Here.
Great.
You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.
I guess this'll be fine.
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing. Why?
How would you feel about taking out Tag? I'll pay.
It's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him.
Really? Because I could kind of use the money.
He's new in town and he doesn't have any guy friends.
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd appreciate it.
Yeah, okay, no problem.
Thank you.
Ooh, hey, doughnuts!
I know. Let's try a look of far-off wonderment.
Gaze into our future and think about our marriage and the days to come.
Chandler, what is the matter with your face?
This picture should say "Geller and Bing to be married" not "Local woman saves drowning moron." Hey, don't laugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.
That's it, that's it!
Take it, take it!
I like this one.
It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you." Can't all be bad.
Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes.
There it is.
Oh, my God, those are my bedroom eyes?
Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I'm having a good time.
Me too.
Sorry that guy on the subway licked your neck.
No, that's okay. He's a friend.
I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have tickets to the ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.
Yeah, l Well, I missed the semifinals, so I think I would just be lost.
I know it's lame, but I got these tickets from my boss Oh, no, no, no, my God!
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
It's my ex-wife, Whitney.
I cannot deal with her now.
She's crazy.
Okay, I know. Hold on.
Hey, Ross.
Yeah.
That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife out there.
Do you think you could divert her so we could slip out?
What? No.
Okay, but I have two tickets to the ballroom-dance finals.
I don't think so, Pheebs.
All right, I'll do it.
But just because you're a friend.
Okay.
Oh!
Hi, Ginger.
I want my key back.
I don't have it.
It's right there.
Okay, Sherlock.
I'm sorry, but you'd better go.
I just wanted to thank you for diverting Kyle's ex.
You're welcome.
We'll talk about it later.
Hi, Whitney.
Hi, Ross.
Are you ready for breakfast?
Yep.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her.
Can you give me a second while I talk to this woman who, by the way, did not spend the night?
Sure.
Okay.
I did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay?
Watching ballroom dancing?
Yes, that's where we realized we were both super cool people.
Look, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Like what?
Like she's really mean, and she's overly critical and She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you.
Okay.
And she uses sex as a weapon.
Thank you for warning me.
At breakfast, I'll be on alert for room painting and sex weapons.
You're still gonna go out with her?
Yeah.
Well, didn't you hear what I just said?
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.
Listen to me, she is crazy!
Your door isn't soundproof.
You see? Nothing is good enough for her.
Morning.
Hi, Tag.
Did you have fun with Joey?
Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.
That's nice.
Then we went to a bar, and he hooked us up with all these women.
Women? You mean, like old women?
Kind of old, like 30.
I never used to be able to talk to girls in bars but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
That's great.
Joey must have really taught you some stuff.
A little.
How you doing?
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.
Now pretend I have a camera.
You're changing it.
I can't help it.
You want to know what I do when I take résumé shots?
Borrow money from me?
Yeah. Okay, first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous.
So here's what I do. I look down, look down, keep looking down.
Then I look up.
See? Now you try.
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a donut.
Hi.
Hey.
So, I heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Yeah, that guy's all right.
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all "Joey." What?
You know, all the women.
You can't teach someone to be good with women.
That's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
I'm right here.
Would you mind just not going out with him again?
Just the idea of you and he and all these women I know he's my assistant, and we can't date!
But it bothers me, all right?
No, no, no, you can't take him away from me.
I got a great partner to pick up girls with. Finally!
I'm still right here.
Will you talk to him and tell him how unsatisfying this dating-tons-of-women thing is?
What?
I don't want him to meet anybody until I'm over my crush.
I will get over it.
It's not like I love him.
It's just physical.
I get these crushes all the time.
I had a crush on you at first.
I know. Monica told me.
Did you have a crush on me when we first met?
Yeah, sure.
Can you people not see me?
Will you talk to him?
I don't know, Rach.
I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.
One.
No, 10. You said 10.
You can't take that back.
You wanted to talk to me?
I don't know.
You got something for me?
Yeah, this is from Rachel.
Ten. Okay.
Tag, there's such a thing as too many women.
Really?
Yeah, for you.
Hey, there you are.
There I am.
You okay?
Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.
So he gave me an antihistamine.
What?
I fell asleep on the subway and went to Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is far.
What were you thinking?
But don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now.
Okay, see. Look down.
Look down.
Look down.
Chandler?
Yeah?
Hi.
Hi.
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story. Okay?
FYI, she must have shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room.
And his response to each one was, I don't give a tiny rat's ass.  Maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
I don't think we are going to have that problem but maybe it's because I am not emotionally unavailable.
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
I think he can be.
Maybe he wouldn't be if she didn't bring the office home every night.
Excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life.
Well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
I knew you were going to throw that in my face!
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.
What more do you want?!
We want the last 6 years back!
So do we! So do we!
I'm sorry you had to see that.
Morning, Rachel.
Hi.
Hey, so, what'd you do last night?
Went out with Joey.
Yeah?
Another night of bird-dogging the chicas?
No, we had a really good talk.
I don't think I'll do the bar scene anymore.
Wow, I did not see that coming.
It's just not really who I am.
I've always been happier when Why am I telling you this?
You don't care about this stuff.
Yes, I do.
You were saying, I'm happier when I... .  When I'm in a relationship.
I love having a girlfriend.
Really?
Someone I can spoil, you know.
Spoil?
Let me ask you something.
Uh-huh?
Do you believe there's one perfect person for everyone?
I'm starting to.
And if that person's in your life you should do something about it?
Yes. Hell, yes.
All right, then, it's settled.
Okay.
I'm getting back together with my ex.
I would love to!
What?
Hello?
Oh. This is gonna be a while.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
My God!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?
And speaking of being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was.
Oh, he knows.
For the most part.
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.
We kind of need to talk.
Both of you together?
What's up?
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing.
We talked most of the night and realized the reason we're angry with each other is because there are still feelings there.
So. Oh, just say it, Kyle!
We're gonna try again.
What about her whining, and her constant need for attention?
I'll work on that.
Right, because you're so capable of change.
You know, he hums when he pees.
I do know.
Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.
Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
I'm sorry.
Pheebs, you were right about her.
You know, she did try to use sex as a weapon.
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
You know, he hums while he does other stuff too.
We're better off without them.
Even if they break up again, you better not let him in your sad men's club.
Divorced men's club.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.
Hey, guys, check it out.
My mom sent me the paper.
Let's see it.
Oh, yeah, that looks good.
You make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, we look great together.
We really do.
Okay.


"Bates is the world's most expensive form of contraception." Hey.
What kind of talk is that?
The girls at the other colleges we been to, they just put out?
Oh, my god.
It's pretty, huh?
Yeah.
Two to go.
Colby up.
Dad, how come you didn't finish college?
Well, i had that semester and a half at seton hall.
Yeah, and?
Your grandma and grandpa didn't stress college.
They were working- class people.
How come your parents were anti- education?
They weren't anti.
You can't lay it all off on them.
I got into a little trouble when i was a kid.
I heard.
Mm- hmm.
You did?
While in waterville, dine at the stone house, serving the freshest maine lobster since 1840.
Come see our new salad bar, featuring a wonderful... are you in the mafia?
Am i in the what?
Whatever you wanna call it.
Organized crime.
That's total crap.
Who told you that?
Dad, i've lived in the house all my life.
I've seen police come with warrants. I've seen you going out at 3:00 in the morning.
You never seen doc cusamano go out at 3:00 in the morning on a call?
Did the cusamano kids ever find $50, 000 in krugerrands and a. 45 automatic while they were hunting for easter eggs?
I'm in the waste management business. Everybody immediately assumes you're mobbed- up.
It's a stereotype, and it's offensive.
And you're the last person i would want to perpetuate it.
Fine.
There is no mafia.
All right, look.
Med, you're a grown woman, almost.
Some of my money comes from illegal gambling and wha... and whatnot.
How does that make you feel?
At least you don't keep denying it, like mom.
Kids in school think it's actually kind of neat.
They seen the godfather, right?
Not really. Casinowe like.
Sharon stone, '70s clothes, pills.
I'm not askin' about those bums.
I'm askin' about you.
Sometimes i wish you were like other dads.
Then, like mr. Scangarelo, for example.
An advertising executive for big tobacco.
Or lawyers? Ugh.
So many dads are full of shit.
And i'm not?
You finally told the truth about this.
Look, med, part of my income comes from legitimate businesses.
Stock market, i... look, dad, please. Okay?
Don't start mealy- mouthing.
How's my sweetheart?
I'm so pissed i can hardly see.
Why? You gettin' the flu?
No, it's my cousin, svetlana.
The amputee?
Two months she's only in america, and she's already getting married.
You knew the deal. I got two kids high school age.
We talked about this.
Yes, and a wife whenever you want.
What do i have in my life?
Boy, am i glad i called.
Fuck you, then! Hang up!
How are the whirlpool jets?
They get'em in right?
Don't throw up in my face things you buy me, okay?
Her prosthetic leg fell off in a gap store, and he carries her out like a knight in white satin armor.
I gotta go.
Uh, my daughter's comin'.
Jesus.
Yeah. How ya feelin'?
Oh, better, actually.
Fever just broke.
I miss you two.
How's the interviews going?
Good.
Real good.
Oh, yeah?
Did she like bates?
Anything to get her off of this berkeley kick.
What the fuck?
Tony?
Yeah, yeah.
Look, i'll call you back from the motel.
Meadow! Come on!
Come on.
Get in.
Okay, okay!
What's the rush?
Geez, dad!
What's going on?
I think i saw an old friend, that's all.
You know that guy at the gas station?
Maybe not.
Probably not.
Then what?
Dad, slow down!
Dad, jesus, what's with you?
It's all right.
fucking maniac!
What's going on?- just foolin' around.
Dad... colby. Turn.
Colby. Turn left.
It's to the left!
Left!
Dad!
See? That's'cause you're talkin' to me so much.
Hey, this gets us toward colby anyhow.
Dad, that's our motel.
Hello. Our motel's right there.
Do you know that guy?
Nah. It wasn't him.
Bada- bing.
Take this number down and call me back.
Now? It's pourin' down here.
Mmm. Bonjour.
Room service et arrivee.
Oop.
Why, thank you, kind sir.
What? You said poached eggs.- you're not gonna eat'em now, after all that work.
I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach.
Anthony, why don't you go over to jason's, play nintendo?
Nope. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No kisses. Cooties.
I'll be back in, like, an hour.
Okay.
Oh, motherfucker.
A real fuckin' shit.
Hey. I'm not sure, but i think i just saw fabian petrulio.
Refresh my memory.
Was he before your time?
Made guy. Flipped about ten years ago when he got busted for peddlin' "h." Rat fuck took out a lot of people, a lot of people from our outfit.
My old man was sick.
He never recovered when he heard the news.
You saw this guy?
That's what i'm sayin'.
I think i did, but i'm not sure.
Up in maine? What the fuck?
He went into the witness protection program.
Then they kicked him out.
Now he goes to colleges and gets paid all kinds of money to talk about what a big, bad mafioso he was.
Piece of shit.
Febbie and me partied a couple of times, but jackie aprile knew him good.
They did a couple of counts together up in lewisburg.
You know that bust that was in his rec room of sinatra?
Febbie made it for him in a prison workshop.
That was frank, that bust?
I always thought it was shaquille.
Fucker needs to practice a little on lips.
Yeah, i know. Anyway, run these plates for me.
Go ahead.
Maine, d- x- 6- 6- 9- 2- 0.
Call you back tonight at 10:00. all right?
Hey.
What's wrong with the phone in your room?
Nothin'. Takin' a walk, saw the phone. Figured i'd give christopher a call.
Oh, yeah?
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. They got a leak in the roof, though.
Is that all right?
Uh- huh.
Huh?
Who is it?
Father phil.
Just a second.
Oh, jesus.
Oh, my god.
Look at you!
Oy!
I hope i'm not barging in.
Oh, no, i was, uh, watching tv.
Oh. I was over at the clothing drive, and i thought you were up in maine.
Oh.
By the way, your marchino pedal pusher suit, it just flew out of there.
Oh, good, good, good.
So anyway, jean cusamano said you were ill.
Yes, i was. The flu that was going around?
Yipes.
Yeah. I still have a little fever, but, uh... i also have a confession to make, carm.
Uh... i- i have a jones for your baked ziti.
Oh.
Sure. Any time.
I have some in the freezer.
I can reheat it.
It's so much better that way, isn't it? The mozzarella gets all nice and chewy.
I like that too.
I was having a little fernet.
Yeah.
Settles the system.
Would you like something?
Some wine, if it's open.
Mm- hmm.
So, how's med and tony's trip going?
I should know? He doesn't have time to talk to me for two lousy minutes.
Oh, geez.
Dad, stop staring.
Why are you doing that?
It's an exciting time.
I can't tell you how proud i am of you.
A real student at casa soprano.
And she looks like one of the models right out of italianvogue.
Italian, italian, italian.
Thank you.
You're definitely up to something.
Oof! How'd you get so cynical?
That stuff we talked about before.
How's that sittin' with you?
Like i wasn't 90% sure already.
What about your brother?
Does he know?
I think so.
There was a time when the italian people didn't have a lot of options.
You mean like mario cuomo?
Sorry.
You know, i put food on the table.
My father was in it.
My uncle was in it.
Maybe i was too lazy to think for myself... consider myself a...rebel.
Maybe being a rebel in my family would have been sellin' patio furniture on route 22.
In college, nothing interested you?
Nah, i barely got in.
Well, kind of liked history.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Napoleon, the roman empire.
The potsdam conference... that kind of thing.
What's the potsdam conference?
Pots- damned if i know now.
Oh, my god.
Dad, i have something to tell you.
Yeah?
You're not... no! Jesus!
A couple of weeks ago, me and some friends, we were doing speed.
We did kind of a lot of it for a while.
You what?
It was just between homework and sats and just general pressure of life.
We needed something to keep going.
That crap'll kill you.
I know.
I oughta slap the shit outta you. Where did you get it?
If i thought this was gonna be a lecture, i never would have told you.
Take a reality check. What do you think i'm gonna say?
Where did you get it?
No way i'm telling you, especially after this reaction.
Why did you tell me?
You were honest with me today.
I won't be doing it again.
It got too scary.
Jesus, right under my nose.
You think you'd know.
No, dad, you won't.
I'm glad you told me, in spite of everything.
I'm glad i did too.
I'm glad we have that kind of relationship.
Tony hates building fires.
We have this beautiful fireplace, and those same three logs have been in there since lincoln split them.
Fear of fire.
Good deterrent to keep out of hell.
Maybe there is hope for him.
Oh. I got something for you.
That's what we were talking about.
The chapter on buddhism is spectacular, but i don't want you going over to those zany zennies.
Fat chance. It's funny.
I could never just sit on the floor and think of nothing.
Thank you.
Sure.
You'll see how islam has gotten a bad rap in current culture, and... boy, this chianti, though, is beyond reproach.
Word up.
dad.
Thought you fell in.
This is carrie and lucinda.
How ya doin'?
They go to colby.
Yeah? Why don't you hang out with them?
Dad.
What better way to learn about the college?
Yeah, maybe, but... no, no, that'd be cool.
Please excuse him.
No, really.
We love to dish the school.
Well... go ahead.
Okay.
Now, med, no drinkin'.
Girls, you see that she sticks to cokes.
I'll come back for you in an hour and a half.
Be good.
Yo.
What do you got?
Wet shoes.
You chose this life.
You don't want to work in the rain, try out for the yankees.
The car is registered to fredrick peters, 38 washington street, waterville, maine.
It's off route 201.
I looked it up.
Fredrick peters.
Fabian petrulio.
Good match, huh?
I guess. I don't know.
T, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I got meadow here.
Jesus.
Fuckin' nightmare. You want, i'll fly up and take care of it.
You're a good kid.
You stay put.
Maybe call pussy or paulie.
What, they can do it, but i can't?
Don't be sensitive. They had a friend, jimmy, die in prison on account of this scumbag.
All right, i'll let'em know.
Fuck, i gotta do my homework and positively i. D. This guy.
I thought you said it was him.
I haven't seen him in 12 years. I gotta make sure.
All right, i'll call you around midnight. Sit tight.
You think i'm a schnorrer, don't you?
A who?
Yiddish.
It means somebody who always shows up in time for free grub.
Well, you're here a lot.
And you're a man.
You like to eat.
I can't get over you with that yiddish.
Oh, that's, uh... my neighborhood in yonkers was mixed.
Jewish and italian, you know?
Eh, a heady brew.
What does that mean, "heady"?
Mmm. Melting pot.
Some vigor.
Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm calling for tony soprano.
Cajun stuffed olives?
Who can i say is calling?
This is dr. Melfi.
His nurse?
No. Is... is this mrs. Soprano?
Uh, that's right.
And you are again?
Jennifer melfi.
Dr. Melfi?
Jennifer.
Lovely name.
No, he's not home.
Could i impose on you to, uh, to tell him that i need to reschedule monday's appointment.
I'm down with the flu.
Does he have your number?
Let me give it to you in case.
I lost my pencil, up his ass.
I'll tell him you called.
Why does he have to lie?
Why couldn't he tell me his therapist is a woman?
What is he hiding?
Maybe he did tell you, and you didn't hear him clearly.
Oh, please.
Here's your fernet.
Why wouldn't he tell me, unless he's screwing her.
Carmela, please.
And i thought he was changing.
I thought therapy was gonna clear up the fuckin' freak show in his head.
Carmela. I'm sure you're wrong about them.
Therapy is a start.
It's a good start, but, yes, it doesn't fix the soul.
He's gonna need help from other sources to repair that.
Well, then you talk to him.
You help him.
But, well, there you go.
W- will he listen?
He must be a very unhappy man.
He's unhappy!
Sleep is my number one... aw, shit.
Why go into it?
Good thing it's full of air bubbles.
Mommy?
Yes, bear?
Would you put me to bed?
I'm scared.
Sure, honey. Hold on.
I thought she was sleeping.
Yeah, well, she woke up.
Daddy's gonna come too, sweetie.
We'll both put you to bed.
Hurry, daddy.
Yeah, yeah.
These red pepper flakes really make all the difference.
Mm. Spicy.
Good as willem dafoe was, i cannot picture that jesus looked like him.
Could you pass the cheese?
Not that he didn't do a good job, willem dafoe, but the story's confusing.
So he gets down offthe cross?
Mm.
You know, originally, bobby d. Was supposed to have that role?
Really?
Oof.
Mm- hmm.
Different picture.
Oh, totally.
You talkin' to me, pilate?
You must be talkin' to me, 'cause i don't see nobody else here, except barabbas here.
You know what's remarkable?
If you take everything jesus ever said, add it up, it only amounts to two hours of talk.
No.
Mm- hmm.
No, but wait.
I heard the same thing about the beatles.
Except it was if you add up all their songs, it only comes to ten hours.
Yes.
Of course, it wasn't just what christ said.
It was his deeds.
See, that's my question.
I understand what he did, but a lot of what he said, i don't get.
Like,"the sun rises on the just and the unjust alike"?
Why?
Because. Christ was saying that we're all... that whores will go to heaven before a lot of the righteous?
Uh- huh.
That's not right.
Let's face it, father.
We got some major contradictions here.
It's about love.
Think about it like that.
What does that mean?
It means, hopefully, someday, we will learn to tolerate, accept and forgive those that are different.
Change through love.
Well.
Well... oh, man, i better get going.
Where you going?
You just got here.
It's getting late.
But it's pourin' rain out.
And i know you love that dvd player.
I gotremains of the day.
Hmm.
See?
Do i know you?
Anything with emma thompson, i'm there.
Father phil, i didn't know you looked.
What?
To take in through the eyes a beautiful woman?
Is that so different than a sunset, a douglas fir, or any of god's handiwork?
Hey, fred.
Hey, tanky.
What do you say?
You gonna give away any homemade cheese this year?
For what they get for cream, i don't know.
Listen, tank, anybody been lookin' for me or askin' any questions about me?
Big guy.
New york sounding?
Is there a problem?
No, no. Nah, dipshit hit me with his boat while i was tubin' on caribou lake.
Claims it was my fault.
If he shows up, you want me to give you a call?
Yeah, i wouldn't mind.
Do that. Thanks.
You ready?
Yeah. Let's go.
No one was asking for you, fred.
All right, vitus.
Thanks.
Hello, rat.
Please leave me alone, miss kenton.
Why won't you show me your book?
This is my private time.
You're invading it.
Oh, is that so?
Yes.
I'm invading your private time, am i?
Yes.
What's in that book?
Come on. Let me see.
Or are you protecting me?
Is that what you're doing?
Would i be shocked?
Would it ruin my character?
Let me see it.
Father, turn it off.
I can't handle it.
What?
What is it?
Oh, father, i'm a terrible person.
Oh, no.
You're a wonderful woman.
Oh, it's been building in me.
I need to get it out.
There's so much in me, i wanna... i wanna... carmela, if i can help.
Please.
How?
How long has it been since you last confessed?
Uh... uh... i, uh... if you like, i can do this with you.
You mean right here, father? Now?
The whole world is god's house.
He hears and sees everything.
Forgive me, father, for i have sinned.
It has been four weeks since my last confess... what ami talkin' about?
That's a lie.
I haven't truly confessed in tw- twenty years.
Go on.
I have forsaken what is right for what is easy, allowing what i know is evil in my house; allowing my children... oh, my god, my sweet children... to be a part of it becausei wanted things for them.
Wanted a better life, good schools.
I wanted this house.
Wanted money in my hands... money to buy anything i ever wanted.
I'm so ashamed.
My husband.
I think he has committed hor- horrible acts.
I think he has... you know all about him, father phil.
I'm the same.
I've said nothing.
I've done nothing about it.
I got a bad feeling.
It's just a matter of time before god compensates me with outrage for my sins.
All right, come on.
Oh, tequila breath.
Whew!
Sorry, dad.
It's all right, kiddo.
Just hang onto me.
Don't throw up on that dress, or i'll have to tell your mother everything.
This guy was giving me tequila shooters.
Oh... oh, god, everything is spinning.
You're not mad, are you, daddy?
Little bit.
Where are the keys?
I gave them to you.
i love you, dad.
I know.
You must truly repent, genuinely and honestly.
And in the future, you must renounce all these actions, and then god will absolve you.
I don't know, father.
I'll try.
But i still love him.
I still believe he can be a good man.
Then you help change him into a better man, and then you will have done good in god's eyes.
I think you should take communion.
Yeah.
Why do you have that with you?
Unfortunately i had to say mass for someone in intensive care.
Lord, i am not worthy to receive thee.
But just say the word, and i will be healed.
And i will be healed.
This is the body of christ.
It was broken for you.
This is the blood of christ.
It was shed for you.
Accept the spirit of christ, our lord and savior.
Amen.
In the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit.
Amen.
Dad?
I booked a seat on a boston flight, tomorrow, 4:00.
Best i could get.
Don't come.
I'll make sure you and meadow clear the state before anything happens.
We don't ever meet face to face.
This is my thing.
I am your soldier, antonio.
This is my duty, like we're always talkin' about.
The way this went down, this is my call.
I gotta vouch for this myself.
Clippin' a famous rat would put me a cunt hair away from bein' made.
He might have recognized me at the gas station.
He could lam anytime.
You stay put.
End of discussion.
Why are you using the pay phone again?
These walls are like paper. I didn't want to wake you up.
Dad, please don't lie to me.
Let's go back to bed.
Lying down made me throw up.
Hello.
Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, yeah.
Was it fun?
Oh, good.
Oh, you... you wanna sleep over there?
Okay. Love you.
That was a. J.
He's sleepin' over.
Oh, i see.
He's at a friend's house.
Oh.
The pucillos.
I don't know if you know them.
No, i... oh.
Oh... oh, i... what?
Oh!
Are you all right?
Father phil?
Are you all right?
Hello.
Hello?
Ow! Don't!
Wanna stop and get a beer? Huh?
No?
I'll pick you up in a little while.
You knock'em dead.
Aren't you coming in?
No, i left my watch at the motel.
I'll catch up to you later.
Grab me a student paper.
You should have some coffee.
Last night... yep.
We didn't do anything out of line?
There's nothing to apologize about.
Right.
That's right.
I should get dressed, get goin'.
Anthony junior will be home soon.
Oh, my god. My car's been out there all night in plain sight.
If we didn't do anything wrong, we didn't do anything wrong.
Is there a commandment against eating ziti?
It's okay.
Take a shower, get dressed.
Don't forget your sacrament kit, whatever.
I'm home!
Carmela.
I don't know where to begin.
It's... it's not that i don't have desire for you in my heart.
Marrone, father, please.
But last night was one of the most difficult tests from god ever for me.
What are you talkin' about?
We're friends.
What's that look about?
What, i look some way?
I was just thinkin' about when we watched casablancalast week.
That new print is great, huh?
You know when bogie says, "of all the lousy gin joints in the world, why'd she have to pick mine?" Of all thefinukpriests in the world, why did i have to get the one who's straight?
Carmela... come on. It's a joke.
I would have done it myself last night, but some people came along.
But anyway, it's a gray town car, new model.
You pick'em up on the colby campus.
Stay on'em.
Where on the colby campus?
What'd i just say?
His kid's applyin'.
The fuckin' admissions office.
Oh. Okay.
You follow'em.
An hour outta town, you pull up alongside... boom! Twelve- gauge.
Fuck that.
Do what i ask, or you'll never get another bag off me.
No, no. Fuck that.
Fuck that!
You want the cops to find out who burnt down the historical house?
Fuck you, fuck- wad!
We were volunteer firemen together, asshole! I know!
Yeah, is dougy in?
Good mornin', rat.
Who are you?
What is this?
Don't make me laugh.
You pimp! You fuck!
Teddy, there must be something we can do... tony. It's tony, you fuck.
You know how much trouble you're in now? You took an oath, and you broke it!
I could've killed you last night, outside the motel.
Your daughter was drunk, remember? I was there in the parking lot.
I had a gun, but i didn't do it.
Because of her, i told myself, "it's just a coincidence.
He's takin' his little girl to college." One thing about us wiseguys, the hustle never ends.
You shot me at that motel, your life would've been flushed down thepiscia- do!
Please, tony, i'm begging!
Jimmy says hello from hell, you fuck!
Where have you been?
I went back to the motel, they didn't have the watch.
So i went to the restaurant.
They was closed. I had to wait for them to open.
Restaurant had your watch?
I took it off in the bathroom when i was washing my hands.
You ready?
Don't wanna be late for bowdoin.
Dad, what's up with that?
Oh, uh, the restaurant.
I tried the back door.
There were puddles.
It was dumb.
I know.
Your hand is bleeding.
Dad, where did you go?
You saw that man, didn't you?
I cut it on a screen door.
What man?
The man you said you didn't know.
Ah, va a napoli.
What do you think happened?
I don't know.
You got in a fight?
You don't know.
You're makin' a big deal outta this, and you don't know.
You were on the pay phone again last night at 1:00 in the morning.
I was on the pay phone at 1:00 in the morning?
Excuse me, miss cuervo anejo.
You can't be trusted to remember what happened last night, 'cause you were seeing pink elephants.
I warned you not to drink.
Dad, you're being honest with me, right?
Pretty soon here you're gonna start hurtin' my feelings.
We have that kind of relationship, you said.
That's right.
We do or we don't.
Takes two to tango.
Dad... what?
Nothing.
I love you.
I love you too.
Where's my paper?
I forgot.
She forgot.
Miss soprano, come on in.
Shall we talk about your future?
Oh, here they are, the two ivy leaguers.
Mwah! How was it?
Do you's want something to eat?
It was good.
I gotta call hunter.
Hey.
Gee, she spared me no boring detail.
I'll be back.
What a trip.
I'm beat.
What, new england?
It's so gorgeous.
Hmm. You still sound a little nasal, but you look better.
Any cold pasta?
There was some ziti, but it all got eaten.
The whole tray?
From last sunday?
Monsignor jughead was here.
If you are referring to father intintola, yes, he was.
Hmm.
He spent the night here.
Yeah, right.
Okay.
The priest spent the night here. What happened?
Nothing.
Where was anthony?
He was sleeping over at jason's.
The priest spent the night here, nothin' happened, and you're tellin' me this because... you might hear something, take it the wrong way.
His car was out front all night.
You know what?
This is too fucked up for me even to think about.
What'd you guys do for 12 hours? Play, uh,"name that pope"?
He gave me communion.
Oh, i'll bet he gave you communion.
Excuse me?
The guy spends the night here with you, and all he does is slip you a wafer?
That's verging on sacrilege.
Oh, i didn't mean to verge.
You think i'm lying?
I don't know, but the whole thing sounds... would i have told you about it voluntarily if there had been anything to be ashamed of?
Do i look like the friggin' thornbird over here?
He's a fag. That's it.
'Cause otherwise, i gotta question what i'm hearin' here.
Oh, tony, you are a sketch.
Oh, by the way, your therapist called.
Jennifer?
Carm.

Oh  around Lincoln, but 685 is looking jim-dandy in both directions.
More traffic reports on the five, but coming up, beautiful Kimberly with complete Accu-Weather  Oh.
Oh.
of the quiet life 
we'll never know 
for the runaway bus 
for the things you've never done 
and life is cruel 
this town called malice 
of disused milk floats 
to their hearts 
letters on the line to dry 
make you stop believing 
fast and furious 
ba-da-ba

Danny Wright.
Garrison & Wright.

Very good.
Well, that's fantastic.
That's great, Danny.
I needed a day like this.
I hear ya.
I've had a tough couple years.
I was with this business out of Denver for nine years.
And out of the blue they just They laid me off.
Oh Yeah. Just like that.
And it was, I don't know, two and a half years ago.
I've been struggling back ever since.

Today you're a man again.
Yeah.
And to be a man, after they fuck you and destroy your self-respect Well, that is a great thing.
Thank you.
Dos margaritas, por favor.

Fourteen years.

High school sweetheart.
It's true.
Unbelievable.
The fuckin' American dream, huh?
Yeah. What about you?
What do you do for a living?
Any kids?
You got kids, Danny?
Oh, no.
I crossed the line.
No, no, no. You did not.
I did.
You did not cross the line.
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
We lost our son three years ago.
It was a school bus accident.
Fourteen children lived that day and one died.
That was Henry.
We, uh had a bad run for a while.
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.
What?
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.
One's a midget, and the other's got a dick 15 inches long.
W-what are you saying?
I'm trying to change the subject.
The midget says to the bartender, "They call my amigo the human swizzle stick.
You know what they call me?" This is incredible.
What?
You're... very rude.
I'm trying to change the subject.
Thank you very much for the drink.
Goodbye. Good night.
Thank you.
Don't you wanna hear the punchline?
It's a fucking good one.
Gracias.
you can't dig nothin' 
or are you just talkin'?
You sure you don't want to switch?
No, no, get outta here.
You're the one with the kids.
You're the one with the tree.
You wanna flip another coin?
Somebody's gotta stay for now.
I'll call you the minute I hear.
Oall me sooner.
Oh, God.
What?
My cell phone.
I think I left it at the front desk.
Watch my stuff for a sec?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
What?
I couldn't help but overhear.
Yeah. So you're spying on my personal conversations now, huh? Great.
Something about the asshole buyers not being completely convinced.
And now wanted to hear other pitches?
Pfff!
Sorry about that.
I-I knew things were too good to be true anyway.
I'm sorry about the circumstances, but I'm glad you're still in town.
It gives me the opportunity to tell you how truly embarrassed I am about last night.
See? See, the thing is I liked you.
I kind of enjoyed talking to someone, you know, just... talking.
Really?
Yeah.
And yet I tell you about my dead son, and you mock it.
I lost my wife.
I was 24 years old, I was drunk, I plowed our car into an oak tree.
Jesus.
Since then, I've soiled my way through life, been a magnificently cold moron.
I run away from anything that resembles an emotion.
Thus, you tell me about your dead son, I tell you a joke about a 15-inch schlong.
So you can forgive me, huh?
Better I remember it now than somewhere over Amarillo.
Right.
All right.
Speak to you mañana, right?
Yeah, yeah.
It's gonna be all right.
I know.
Danny?
Hey, Danny.
Wait. Hey.
I've got an extra ticket to the bullfights this afternoon.
Supposed to be a good one.
It would mean a great deal to me if you would join me.
Oh, I'm so Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you, and I... I can't.
I can't. I have work.
On a Sunday afternoon?
Ever seen a bullfight?
No.
You haven't seen the real Mexico Oity until you've seen a bullfight.
Oome on.
Olél Olél Olél 
Olél Olél 
Bean is not gonna believe this.
I can't wait to tell her.
ever find a woman like that?
A woman you can share everything with.
She's pretty special.
You must be too.
I could learn from you.
You want my mortgage, my blood pressure?
I've never had my blood pressure taken, and I wouldn't know how to get a mortgage for all the teenage twat in Thailand.
You don't own a house?
No house.
No apartment, no address.
You bullshittin' me?
I shit you not. Montecristo?
Uh... yeah!
Thanks.
You don't have a permanent address?
Where do you live?
I live wherever I'm working.
So, what do you do, Julian?
What do you possibly do you don't have a permanent home or an address?
I'd rather not say.
Oh, my God, did you see that?
Jeez, it's so bloody.
We're lucky.
That matador was very good.
It's much worse when they're mediocre.
Why?
A great matador, he can kill the bull with one plunge of the blade.
A lesser one, he's going to have to plunge that blade more than once.
That makes the crowd very unhappy.
They don't like to see the bull suffer.
No.
No, no. They clearly care so very much about these animals.
They respect these beasts.
They want 'em to die with honor.
That's ridiculous.
There's no honor in being killed by a man with a sword whether it's one plunge or 20.
Ah, you're wrong.
You're very wrong.
There is honor.
How would you know?
I do.
You're a mysterious man, Julian.
Mm-hm.
It's... confidential.
Oonfidential?
What, do you work for the government?
The government?
Pfff! Please.
You know what they pay?
Hmph! Forget it.
Watch the picadors.
You a spy? Something like that?
You read too many novels, Danny.
Huh? You a spy?
Huh?
So now you're not going to tell me. It's OK.
It's OK.
All right.
Hm. All right.
If I tell you, will you keep your cool?
What do you mean?
We're in public, and I don't want you to lose your shit.
Lose my shit?
My God, w-what are you gonna tell me?
Sometimes Sometimes what?
Sometimes people need to be eliminated.
Oh, come on!
What? You're You're a hit man?
Oh, please.
Please. My handler calls me a facilitator.
A facilitator of fatalities.
That's insane.
Think what you like.
I gotta hand it to ya, Julian, you're one of the best bullshit artists I've met, and I've met some.
You're absolutely right, Danny.
My name is Earl Johnson.
I sell aluminum siding in Minneapolis.
You actually kill people for a living?
I do what I'm asked to do.
What makes sense to me.
For like, the Mob?
I tend to be hired on the more kind of anonymous high-paying jobs.
Oorporate gigs.
Oorporate gigs?
I'm a great helper in getting deals closed.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe in the Easter Bunny.
I don't believe you.
Oome on! Oorporate gigs.
Think what you will.
Ridiculous.
Yes!
Oorporate gigs.
Yes! My God I knew there was a reason I never told anyone what I did.
Uh-huh.
All right, see that guy over there?
Fat man and little girl?
Yeah.
Say I wanted him dead.
I want him dead, his family dead.
Dead. Right now.
Right here.
Right now? Oouldn't happen.
I know, but say that it could.
Money's no object.
You sure you wanna know?
Yeah.
Yeah, you sure?
Yeah.
I want you to facilitate it.
OK, Danny.
All right, come with me.
Huh?
Let's go.
Olél Olél Olél I'm a big fan of the gotta-pee theory of assassinations.
Gotta pee?
Everyone's gotta pee.
Ah.
Now ask me for a cigarette.
What?
Do it.
Oan I have a cigarette, please?
Sure. But these things'll 
Now, look around.
They're scary.
Yes and no.
Why?
They seem more interested in the beautiful women coming and going from the ladies' room.
That's good for us.
Just like those men over there at the concession stand.
They're only interested in us if they see us walking over with our wallets open.
No one is watching the men's room.
The gotta-pee theory.
You're catching on.
Now, escape routes.
Escape routes?
Don't wanna get caught, right?
Don't get caught, it sucks.
See the main exit?
Yeah.
That's a traffic jam.
Where else?
You tell me.
Uh, that door over there.
If it... if it weren't locked.
Vietnamese girl I once knew had her legs so locked together I couldn't get a whiff of her spring roll.
Two drinks, half a Quaalude later, I was at an all-you-can eat buffet.
Every lock can be broken.
It's just a matter of will and whether it's worth it.
This looks like it's worth it.
Why are we buying the cigarettes?
'Oause I wanna smoke.
Gracias.
Oome over here.
Now do your shoelaces up.
What time's our flight to Florida, Seymour?
I think 2:00, Derrick.
Let's go, Seymour.
Holy shit!
You ready?
Ready for what?
You wanted to see what I do, right?
Yes.
Yes, I've been watching.
But, you know What? Show-and-tell is over.
The real deal is about to start.
The real deal?
Mm-hm.
Show-and-tell is for sissies.
But a sissy I'm not.
Oome on!
My God, fire!
Oome on. It's a distraction.
Are you crazy?
Fire or tits, either one will distract most cops.
Are you ready to finish what we started?
That was extremely dangerous.
You proved your point.
Baloney! Baloney!
The cops may have gone towards the fire, but his bodyguard probably stood firm.
Bodyguard?
If I'm asked to kill, they have a bodyguard.
If they didn't, they'd ask you.
So I slit the guard's throat in one move, push him into the bathroom And now we're set up for the kill.
Where the hell did you get the knife?
He's not peeing, so it must be number dos.
OK, joke's over.
Point made, Julian.
Not yet. Not yet.
Point made.
The point's made.
Let's get out of here Don't fuckin' ruin things, OK? Don't do it.
OK. Julian?
I'm asking you to stop this!
No way, job's not done.
But this is not a job!
You said money was no object!
This is want you wanted?
No!
You helped me.
I didn't help you!
Oh, yes, you did!
Oh, yes, you did!
No! No, no.
Oh, God, no!
Oh! Disculpa me, por favor.
Lo siento.
Fun, huh?
That was incredible!
You scared the hell out of me!
You liked that. You did?
I really bought it!
What, that I'd stab a stranger?
Just like that?
A complete stranger?
Well, yes!
Yes, I did.
I'm not psychotic.
No, I know.
Psychopathic, not psychotic.
I don't think you're a psychopath.
Well, I kill people. Doesn't that seem a wee bit psychopathic?
Well, yeah, but Don't get the wrong impression.
Huh?
Because we share a laugh doesn't mean I'm not unsavory.
No, what you do is unsavory.
You know what they say.
You are what you do.
Gracias.
Gracias.
Tell me will Bean stay with you if this job doesn't come through?
What?
Will Bean stay with you if you continue this losing streak without any end?
If she ever left me I'd fall apart You're not answering my question.
To be quite honest I don't know how much faith the woman has left in her.
Hey.
Oomforting me?
Hey.
Let's change the subject. Please.
I agree.
Something sunnier.
Sunnier.
Absolutely.
There's something I wanted to talk about.
It's a favor, really.
Sure.
It's big, if that's OK.
A big favor.
No, it's OK.
See, the thing is I could use your help.
Help in what?
I'm down here, I finished my otherjob early, so I let it be known.
You let it be known?
Yeah, to the powers that be, that I was available.
The powers that be?
Yeah.
Anyway, they called me up.
An urgent thing. Has to happen today.
An-anotherjob?
Mm-hm.
Jesus Ohrist.
The thing is, I could really use your help.
You're kidding right now.
I'm as serious as an erection problem.
I mean, I Gracias.
I can't help you, Julian.
You could.
Well, I could, but I-I can't, I'm not gonna help kill an innocent man.
Who says he's innocent?
This is ridiculous.
Just assisting.
No!
You'd just have to No, no, no, no!
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.
Bup You're being childish.
Ooga-shacka, ooga-shacka Not listening.
Ohildish.

All I'm asking you Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta!
All right. All right.
I won't tell you.
Good.
Won't mention it.
Great.
I won't say that all you have to do is trip on the street.
I can't believe you just said that.
Just trip in half an hour so his bodyguards look the other way.
No way.
Fifty thousand dollars is what I could pay you.
No.
A lot of money. Oash.
It could be interesting and fun.
I said no.
He's a prick, a real prick!
I don't give a darn who he is or what he did or anything like that.
I'm not gonna help you, Julian.
I'm not gonna do that.
And if you bring it up again, I'll... I'll leave.
Fine.
Fine.
Ohange the subject.
Good. You do it.

Fine.
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a cheerleader.
Really. A cheerleader.
Yeah. I wanted to be thrown in the air and march in the band.
Seriously?
Mm-hm.
That's so funny.
I've got a brother-in-law who was a male cheerleader Jesus Ohrist, Danny!
I'm fucking kidding!
I don't want to talk about cheerleaders unless I talk about getting in a shower with them!
I want to talk about what I wanted to, which you don't want to!
There's nothing to talk about!
Well, then, it was nice knowing you.
Oh, come Now, Julian Oome on, what are you You're leaving?
I've got business to attend to.
I really thought Nothing.
Think nothing. Just consider me the best cocktail party story you ever met.
Bye, Danny.
Julian!
I was right.
I finally got in touch with Alejandra and she said her bosses are leaning towards Cardenas and his group, and not us.
Now, things still might break in our favor.
I mean, their first instinct was to go with us, but they're getting intense pressure to sign with a Mexican company.
I'm trying to get Antonio so I can set up one more meeting with you guys tomorrow.
I'll call you when I hear something.
So hang in there.
It's not over yet.
Danny, it's Julian.
Oome on, Danny, I just want to say I'm sorry.
I know it's late, and I'm a little fucked up.
But... I'm sorry.
I'm a mess! I'm a fucker! Ha!

I infringed I infringed on your kindness, but please let me tell you I'm sorry.
Let me apologize.

hanging about 
to see me cry 
to go out at any time 
it's such a crime 
wanna be loved by anyone 
It happens every day 
Hello, Julian.
Getting some culture?
Anytime I can.
You look tired.
I am.
I need a break.
What are you saying, Julian?
Moscow, Las Vegas, Vienna, the Philippines.
Now Budapest. I'm exhausted.
Well, you know what it's like.
You take a break, we go with a younger, cheaper kid.
Oh.
He does all right.
Maybe we don't want you back when you're ready to get back in the game.
You'll always want me.
No, not always.
Not if we can save a few dollars.
Not if it gets sloppy again, like in Manila.
That was one time.
Made some people nervous.
It made me nervous.
Well, that's why I need a break.
I don't want to have that happen again.
It can't.
I know, that's what I'm saying.
But I'm feeling burnt-out, I'm feeling shaky.
Oan you believe this shit?
I mean, can you believe the words coming out of my mouth?
Did you ever think you'd live to see the day?
I never thought you'd live to see the day.
There's not a retirement home for assassins, is there?
Archery at four, riflery at five?
A little early-bird dinner at six?
Goddamn it, you leave the game, even for a while, I don't know if they'll let you back in.
And then what are you gonna do?
Waste days picking up illiterate teenagers for suck-and-fuck sessions behind the Old Navy store?
Sounds delightful to me.
Julian, do this job.
If you don't, you're going to regret it, I promise you.
How do you know?
Just do it, Julian.
Please, do it. OK?
Oh.
We have a problem, Mr. Randy.
The problem is Julian Noble.
Seems he didn't deliver the portfolio.
You know it says it took 53 years to paint this ceiling.
People are upset, Mr. Randy.
Mr. Stick is upset.
Mr. Stick knows?
Mr. Stick knows.
Well, he knows we can fix it.
I'm just the messenger.
But he knows we can fix it.
We always fix any problems.
You can't fix it with Noble.
Ladies.
All right. I'll replace him.
No.
Yes, you'll replace him, but no.
Mr. Stick has asked for other things.
No, it's ridiculous.
Julian has been with us for 22 years.
Two little mistakes Julian Noble... is a dead man.
Oh, that's it, Danny boy!
Oh, yeah!
Give it to me, Danny boy!
Danny boy! Oh! Uh!
Oh! Excellent.
Oh!
Laundry's done.
Oh!
Tomorrow's four years.
I know.
It's such a long time, really, when you think about it.
Seems like yesterday, right?
Henry was alive here.
When I was first in high school, I told you they made fun of me.
And they called me Hippo Hips and Plate of Beans, the works.
And even though I did basketball and... and chorus and And I had a few friends and I acted strong I never was.
Because I believed them always, every last cruel word.
And I I always thought I would believe them.
Until I met you.
You arrived in 12th grade and you told me that I was pretty.
And for the first time, I believed it.
You told me that I was sexy.
You were sexy back there on the dryer.
And when Henry died  to stay strong and that we would get through it.
And we did.
We did.
It's because you never gave up on me.
I never could.
I never will.
Who could that be at 11:30 at night?
Yeah?
Yes. Who's there?
Danny, Danny!
Danny with the large white fanny!
Julian!
Would you mind opening up, Danny?
It's freezing out here!
My balls are like bonbons!
I was praying you'd remember me.
It's been a spell.
Please, please, come on Oome on in.
Thank you, thank you.
Oooh!
Hey.
Oh, I decided to How did you find me?
I found a whore with a heart of gold once.
I can find Danny Wright's card in my address book.
Oh.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't realize. Sorry.
It's OK.
You must be Bean.
My wife.
Oh, this Um Oh, my My boots.
I've heard so much about you.
And me, you.
Oh There's no doubt you're every bit as lovely as Danny said.
I always said you were the luckiest man I ever met.
Well What are you doing here, Julian?
I really don't know.
I don't know.
I hope it's all right, my being here.
I mean I guess it's the middle 
Yes, it's Well I could sure use some coffee.
Just a cup.
Yes. All right.
Of course.
I could get coffee.
That'd be great.
Or some whiskey?
Even better.
Mm.
Tonight's a night for whiskey, then.
And song and dance.
Well, whiskey, at least.
This is really odd.
Really, really odd.
I could ask him to leave.
We just asked him to stay.
We could change our minds.
Why? Do you think he's dangerous?
He's an assassin, Bean.
Of course he's dangerous.
But I mean "dangerous" dangerous.
You said he was a nice guy.
He is. For an assassin, he's... very nice.
Fuck.
Fuckity-fuck!
What? I'm allowed to curse.
Especially now.
If not now, when?
True.
This is the fucking perfect time to be fucking cursing.
There's a fucking killer standing in our fucking living room.
Do you think he would show me his gun?
To a stranger, arriving in the middle of the night.
Well, you're not a stranger.
Well, I'm pretty strange.
Be that as it may, you're not a stranger, Julian.
Far from it.
The toast really should be to you, Danny.
And to you, Bean.
For your hospitality and your warmth.
Oh.
I never thought I'd see you again, Julian.
I never thought I'd see you again, Danny.
But, well things, uh Things change.
They just change.
You saved it.
I did.
You saved it.
I can't believe it.
No, it's It touches me that you kept it.
How could I not?
That was a special day.
Yes.
So Danny told you what I did?
Professionally?
Did you bring your gun?
Yes... as a matter of fact.
May I see it?
Really?
Yes, please.
Honey, he's notjust Here you go.
Is that a.38?
Yes, it is.
You know your guns, Bean.
Yes, well My God.
You are a magnificent woman.
Hm.
Bean knows a lot of things about a lot of things.
Bean, tell me, did Danny tell you everything about our time in Mexico together?
Yes, I'm sure. Why?
Oh.
My God, you look great, Danny.
You do too, Julian.
Oh, no.
I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning after the Navy left town.
But you Life's been good to you, am I right?
Pretty good, yeah.
Your work? You have that respect you wanted back again?
I do.
So you got thatjob you were in Mexico for?
We did.
And your luck?
It's better, right?
No more trees in the kitchen?
You told him about that?
And you love Bean more than ever.
Mm. That I do.
Then what more could you want?
Here's a toast.
To a man with respect again, to a woman who's more lovely than any man deserves and to me.
What is the toast to you for?
Toast to a dead man, Bean.
Toast to a dead man.
I had this job in Manila.
Now, normally, this would make me happy.
I like the hot climate.
The guys look like chicks.
It's fucking fantastic.
The thing was, I was burnt-out.
I didn't know it, didn't even know what "burnt-out" meant at the time.
But I was.
I was a classic textbook case.
I was completely losing control of myself.
I tried to counter this with booze, of course, but nothing was working.
I drank and drank and nothing.
I was still feeling edgy, still feeling like my head was going to explode.
So I moved on to my other usual diversions.
A wonderful little whorehouse I knew right off of Mabini Street.
But that wasn't workin'either.
And a good fuck usually does.
Excuse my French.
Go on.
So I had this assignment.
Nothing special, some copper wire executive, someone doesn't want him around.
You know, my usual type gig.
Well, I knew that this copper wire guy always came to this sweaty little outdoor market every Thursday to buy fruit.
The guy liked his fruit.
It was a simple plan.
As he walks through the crowds I bump into him and stab him.
The thing was, I was still a mess.
And every time I looked at the guy, I didn't see him, but I saw a little boy insteadl And it wasn't just any boy.
It was me.
Me, as a child!
It was freaky shit, right?
Real nervous breakdown sort of stuff.
Still readied the knife, still prepared for thejob.
But I couldn't do it.
I just couldn't do it.
Then what happened?
I woke up in a pile of donkey shit.
I fainted.
And I guess I landed in a pile of donkey shit.
And since then, it's been extremely hot and cold.
Some jobs go OK, others not so OK.
And then a few weeks ago I fucked up again. In Budapest.
Froze.
Right at the moment I should have been firing.
And that was that.
And now it's just a matter of time.
Well, isn't there somebody that you can talk to?
Like Mary Beth in Human Resources?
Oome on, this is this is insane.
They're gonna kill you for botching a job?
Mm-hm.
Well, can't you just, you know, say to them, you know, "You know what? I'm sorry.
You know, I was a little burned out, and I'm a little messed up." I mean, can't you do that?
But I mean, you were seeing images of yourself as a small boy.
If that's not a Freudian meltdown, I don't know what is.
But certainly, they have to see that.
No, they don't.
They don't.
I mean, I I'd be dead if my handler hadn't risked his life and tipped me off to the plans.
I barely got out of Budapest alive.
And how did you end up here?
In Denver?
Hm.
That's funny.
Some people run home in a time of crisis.
My problem, the problem I shared with Danny in Mexico, is that I don't have a home.
I mean that's why I'm here.
You're the only friend I have.
Oh, well, that's that's ridiculous.
I... You have... you have friends.
I don't.
I really don't.
You all right?
You're my only friend, and I barely know you.
This home your home  it's the only home I know.
fantastic, Danny.
She's lovely.
You said that to me in Mexico.
And I nodded and listened but now I see.
I see.
You were right.
You told her everything that happened in Mexico?
I told her about our time together, yes.
And where does that story end?
She knows the last I heard of you you were knocking on my room in the middle of the night asking forgiveness for trying to involve me in a job.
That's what you said?
That I knocked and knocked.
And you never answered?
Yes.
I'm a bit drunk.
That's a nice place to be.
Julian, you will stay the night, of course?
Oh, thank you, Bean.
I promise I'll be out of here tomorrow.
Oh, let's not talk about that now.
You know, I don't think I've been up with a guest till 2:30 in the morning in a long time.
It's good, right?
Oh, it's very good.
Hey Oan I turn on your stereo?
Sure. Now?
Yeah, I saw this old record of yours, and I just wanted to hear In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning. You know?
Since we're in the wee small hours of the morning?
Is that OK?
Oertainly. I guess.
I hope you approve, but I would really like to ask your wife to dance.
Julian, you have had too much to drink.
Bean.
Please, may I have this dance?
Bravo! Bravo!
I learned to dance in a South American jail by a chap named Morales.
Well, that's another story, another time.
The final nightcap.
I can't think about the headache I'm gonna have.
Then don't. Or do.
Take three aspirins and a raw egg before you go to bed.
Where'd you hear that one?
The Assassin's Book of Home Remedies?
The only woman I ever loved.
My mother.
What about your wife?
Hm?
My wife?
Danny told me that you were married and that she died in a car accident.
You loved her.
Um Oh, my God!
I can't believe this!
I was never married.
I can't believe this!
No car accident?
No. I'd been insensitive to Danny about your son and was trying to win him over.
It was stupid.
You know what, I'm the one that was stupid.
No, no, no, no, no!
You're not stupid.
I'm a prick! Me, not you!
The thing is, I could have kept lying to you now, but I chose not to, as a sign of respect.
Because... well, now we're friends.
Oh.
We are friends, aren't we?
So, what other bullshit did you pour over me?
Yeah, are you even a hit man, Julian?
Yeah, a facility fatalitator, whatever the fuck you call yourself.
Yes, I am.
And to answer your question, Danny, I lie when I need to, tell the truth when I can.
With you it's mostly been the truth.
Shall I go?
No.
No.
No  Aren't we fucking cosmopolitan?
Having a trained assassin stay over the night.
Letting heartbreaking lies just roll over us like the summer breeze.
Next we shall be wife swapping. Ha!
You don't have a wife.
Remember?
That's a good point.
Danny.
Danny.
No. I don't like chicken.
Oome on.
I've gotta talk to you.
What is it, Julian?
What do you want?
We can't talk about it here.
What?
Oome on.
we're in your rent-a-car.
What is it?
The thing is, Danny the thing I didn't tell you, the thing that I omitted because Bean was present, was that I've been offered a way out of my fatal predicament.
Well, that's good.
I know, I know.
No, that's really good.
What is it?
My handler, Mr. Randy, contacted me like he always does with an ad in the International Tribune looking for cat-sitters in Bali.
Is that how you stay in contact?
Oat-sitter ads?
Yeah.
OK, you know, this is ridiculous.
I'm so tired, Julian.
Well, anyway, he contacted me four days ago and basically said he'd been to the higher-ups and got me a reprieve.
Well, like I said, that's that's... great news.
The thing is he's asked me to do one more job.
I have no choice.
It's do the job or else.
Right.
And that brings us to the dirty little problem.
All right.
What's the problem?
It's a pretty big problem, and you're really not gonna like it.
I'm not gonna like it?
Not at all.
Because the job involves you.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.
What do you think I'm saying?
You know what I think you're saying.
No. I don't think I know what you think I'm saying.
Does somebody want me dead?
No.
What's that?
No one wants you dead, Danny.
Jesus!
No. No You were doing that But I need your help in facilitating a fatality.
What?
I need your help.
No, no, no.
My help is exactly what you don't need.
I'm a mess, Danny, you know that.
I'm a complete mess.
I don't know if I can do this job by myself.
You gotta talk to somebody else, a colleague.
I don't know colleagues.
You must!
I don't.
Well, I can't help you.
I know you're not the ideal candidate No. I'm far, far from ideal, Julian.
Remember my reaction the last time you proposed something this asinine?
That was Mexico.
I was trying to show you a good time!
Oh, so now killing somebody is a good time?
Oan be.
Oh... I'm going to sleep.
Danny, come on.
You don't even need a second person.
Haven't you done these things yourself?
Some jobs are better with two men.
I think it's better if the second man isn't scared shitless, and... and unprepared.
And unqualified and uninterested!
Now I'm gonna go to bed.
I'm in a very dangerous position here.
I'm in no shape to try this myself.
An assassin without confidence is a horrible thing.
It's like a relief pitcher who fumbles the ball.
Tell me you know you mixed two sports in your metaphor.
Huh? I can't do that.
Yeah.
Danny! Danny, please!
I need your help!
Someone's gonna die, a stranger or me.
Which would you rather? Hm?
Look, if I can do the job successfully, I'm free and clear.
Free and clear, Danny!
I have enough money to retire to a beautiful Greek island with beautiful Greeks.
Heaven awaits me, Danny, if you and I do this job.
I can't.
Oh, damn it, Danny!
You're my only friend!
Oh, Julian.
It's true!
And Oh And what?
And  You owe me.
If this were to happen, when would it take place?
Today. The horse races.
Today?
Yeah, Arizona.
No, that couldn't happen.
Sorry, no choice.
Today is the four-year anniversary of my son Henry's death.
We go to the cemetery.
That's what we do.
What time does the cemetery close, Danny?
Well, I-I don't know.
We'll have you back at 4:30, flowers in hand. I promise.
Oh. Oh.
You'll do that? OK.
How will you do that, Julian?
Well, we have a 7:40 plane reservation to Tucson this morning.
Plenty of time to catch the 2:30 back.
We do?
Mm-hm.
I made it yesterday.
First class. Real fancy.
Now, chop-chop.
Upstairs. Get dressed.
Make a story up to Bean.
We've gotta get this road on the show. Eh?
Danny.
to be so bad to you 
that I would never do 
and I would fall from grace 
right from my face 
when we used to dance?
from circumstance 
We were young 
songs unsung 
of the moment 
your heart meant 
what your heart meant 
I did it. I did it.
I did it, I leaned against that.
I was yawning, and I apologize. I just Ah. Turn it off!
Sorry.
Bingo.
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Julian!
Hey. Julian!
Julian!
Julian!
Julian?
Hey.
What... what the hell is going on?
Julian!
You drag me out to Arizona, to the goddamn horse races.
To do this job, right?
To do this job, this one lastjob.
To kill somebody that I don't even know so that you can live out the rest of your life with Greeks Beautiful little Greeks, Danny!
We do... I do everything perfectly.
Not you, me. Perfectly.
Did you see me, Julian?
I was brilliant!
You get a clean shot.
You had a clean shot, and you don't take it?
What's going on?
I've lost it, Danny.
Oh, really?
Well, they're gonna kill you.
But I've lost it.
That... that's an unacceptable answer!
But it's the truth.
Oh, jeez.
Hey. Hey.
Ooncentrate here, OK?
I need you to concentrate.
Just look at me, Danny, look at me.
I'm a wreck. I'm a parody.
Julian, you gotta go up there and finish this job.
No, no, just leave me alone.
Please, just forget everything.
I can't believe I'm in a stairwell trying to convince you to assassinate somebody!
Just go. Just go, Danny.
Just go. Go.
No.
No, we're gonna do this.
But I can't.
Julian, you have to.
Hey, you have to, OK?
If you don't, they're gonna kill you.
You understand?
Yeah.
You understand?
And I won't let that happen.
Huh? I refuse to let that happen.
How about that?
We're gonna go up there together, I'm gonna talk you through it.
OK? I'm gonna talk you through it.
And you are gonna do the job that you came to do. OK?
OK? All right?
Huh? Huh?
Yeah.
All right, up. Up, up, up, up.
There you go.
You're gonna stay there with me?
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
You're gonna talk me through it?
That's right.
Thank you.
All right, let's go kill this motherfucker already and get the hell out of here.
Yay!
Thank you.
No, really, I mean it.
I was a mess back there.
You helped me.
You helped me a lot.
I think I can handle the deviant Julian.
I can handle the lying Julian.
I can even handle the killing Julian.
I just don't know if I can handle the humble pie Julian.
Well, enjoy it.
It won't last.
That's a given.
Really, it's no problem.
You said it yourself.
I owed you.
Do you think if you hadn't opened the door that night in Mexico Oity the two of us would be sitting on this plane now?
Probably not.
I want to say I'm sorry.
I know it's late, and I'm a little fucked up.
But I'm sorry.
Oan't you see how guilty I feel?
Danny!
Danny!
Hold on, Julian.
I'm coming.
I don't know what I'll do if I don't get this job.
And you're sure if I kill off this Oardenas guy you'll get the contract?
He's our only competition.
And you can live with that?
Yeah.
You can live with that blood on your hands, hm?
Isn't that what people do?
Don't people successful people always live with blood on their hands?
that night, Julian.
You became my lifelong friend.
I'm not gonna do it for you.
You're making a late night exhausted, desperate decision, and if I did it, you would regret it instantly and feel nothing but guilt and shame for the rest of your life, believe me.
I'm so scared, Julian.
Guys like you you think you have no luck.
But you have all the luck in the world.
You just need to see it.
She's at home waiting for you.
If I did thatjob for you, your luck would run bad for the rest of your days.
You don't want me to do it, anyway.
I know you don't.
You're not that type of person.
Hm.
That's why I like you.
You're the exact opposite of me.
Huh?
I surprised myself.
Well I guess your boss must be satisfied, right?
You completed the assignment, no longer on the hit list.
Well, I'm no longer on the hit list, but I didn't do any assignment.
I don't understand.
I thought your boss wanted you to do this job.
My boss Mr. Stick he was the job.
You mean we just killed We killed the man who wanted to kill me.
Problem solved.
You  You son of a bitch.
Among many other things.
Don't ever hit me again.
Sorry.
nowhere else to run 
for one more son?
the back of my broken hand 
to perfection 
Oh no. Don't make Lisa mad.
She might crush us all with her giant butt.
Shut up, you. Stop teasing the big-bottomed lass.
She's just as God made her Plump as a Christmas goose.
Dad... the kids at school said my butt's big.
That's ridiculous, honey.
You're the cutest little girl I know.
You just have what is known as The Simpson butt.
Permit me to elaborate.
Every Simpson starts with a circle.
Daddy has one big circle here then a smaller one up here two big, sexy circles for eyes one macho muzzle then a snappy new outfit.
Ooh, I'm looking good.
Ooh, cuffs. Yeah.
And for some reason, my hair and ear form an "M" and a "G.
Party! Party!
Party! Party!
You want to know a little trick?
To downsize my derriere, I just tie a sweater around it.
See?
Oh, Homer, you're wasting away to nothing.
You simply must eat something.
Well, you're the boss.
Oh, I love to see my man eat.
Check it out, Homes.
You said if I ever got a hundred on a test, You'd throw me a party.
There's my hundred where's my party?
Nice try, loser.
I bet you made up a fake test.
Nope, it's real Check out the watermark.
All right.
Here's a mistake.
It says the capital of Kentucky... is Frankfort.
Dream on, pal.
Homer, the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort.
Really?
Frankfurter is that anything?
Yes, it's something, dear.
See, it's all legit.
Now make with the party.
All right, boy, which con did you work here?
Copy off another kid?
Pay attention and take notes?
Well, take note of this.
Bart really did get a hundred.
I gave a test on state capitals, but I forgot to roll up the map.
Everyone got a hundred.
I win. P-A-R-T.
Par-tee.
People, please.
It's a school night.
I thought you two broke up.
This means nothing.
Yes, yes, you've made that quite clear.
Maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner.
This store makes me feel even worse about myself.
I heard she's back to her birth weight.
Must be nice.
No, no, the body on this mannequin is all wrong.
I know. It's such an unrealistic standard for young Planing down the thighs, I make four bucks an hour planing down the thighs.
I don't look so bad.
Don't worry, Lisa. You can still find someone to love you.
Now you've got no choice.
Non!
Oh boy, Barty's gonna party.
He sure is if he can keep up with these party animals.
Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Grandma Bouvier and Grampa.
Plus  your school-yard chums: Martin and Ralph.
Bart's my bestest boyfriend.
Oh Mom, this guest list sucks.
It's the best I could do on such short notice.
Where's Milhouse?
He's got the measles.
But we've got him on speakerphone.
Rock on.
You know, the first time I met Bart was at recess in first grade Oh, I told him to use a land line.
Okay, gang, let's get this party started.
or should I say Barted?
For our first game, I need everyone to drawa picture of President Eisenhower.
I drew him with Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent.
Their relationship was frosty at best.
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, Say "goose," you stupid freak.
Oh, Mom, this was the worst party ever.
Gee, I did the best I could Here's Lisa.
She'll save the party.
Honey, sit down.
Have a big slice of cake.
What? I'm not fat enough already?
How could you say that to me?
Lisa,  wait Hello? Hello?
I had to leave 'cause my French bread pizza dinged.
Hello?
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, What's the big deal Bart didn't like his presents.
So what? It's not like he gives us such great gifts.
Remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper?
What was that?
That was crap.
Oh, it's not just the presents.
The kids don't appreciate me anymore.
They'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.
So they're growing up.
Soon they'll be leaving the nest, and you'll have time for yourself.
hundreds of thousands of hours, And then, the peace of the grave.
No!
No, I've got a lot more mothering left in me.
I'll be right here at 3:00 to pick you up.
Then I'll take you to the zoo.
We can eat fries out of a safari hat!
No, thanks. I'm going to stay in the library and do a little reading.
Well, I guess it's just you and me, Bart!
Mom, after that lame party you threw, I'd rather hang out with thunder-thighs here.
They grow up so fast.
They're just asserting their independence.
If a child doesn't do it now, it may never happen.
Seymour! Do you want your vitamin in applesauce?
Or are you gonna take it like a big boy?
Applesauce.
Oh, sure, you love me now, but you'll turn.
Stop struggling  and get in my mouth, jerks!
Aren't you the boy who beats up my son?
Prob'ly.
What's your name?
Simpson.
Oh, yeah. Bart Simpson.
Spiky hair, soft kidneys, always hitting himself?
Those tadpoles are your lunch?
Technically, brunch.
Well, here, take this.
My daughter didn't want the lunch I made.
This sandwich rocks.
My tadpoles seem crude by comparison.
You're nocturnal.
You don't have to impress me by making fun of others.
I already like you.
I'm starting to let down my guard.
Thanks, Mrs. S.
Today didn't totally suck nard.
It's nice to be appreciated.
Whatever.
Take it sleazy.
Mom?!
Nelson? I thought you were sleeping in the park tonight.
Oh, that's okay, the kid don't bother me none.
Hey, Nelson, say hello to Moe.
He said he'd take you camping sometime.
I said I might.
Hey, kids, I just heard they canceled league night down at the bowling alley.
You know what that means?
Open lanes!
Whaddya say?
It'll be BLAM!
Bart, Lisa and Mom.
Mom, when I want lame and needy, I'll call Milhouse.
No offense.
Fine!
I'll take my mothering elsewhere.
Ooh, great roll, Nelson.
Here, I cut up your hot dog for you.
Wow, hot dogs are awesome!
You've never had one before?
No, but I saw some in a catalog once.
People in sweaters were eating them at a picnic.
So, my mom works at Hooters, but  her dream is to go to Vegas and work in a real strip club.
And, uh, where's your dad in all this?
He  went out for a pack of cigarettes and never came back.
He said "smell ya later," but he never smelled me again.
Nelson, how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house?
I have some odd jobs my kids won't do.
Yeah.
I get the feeling Bart isn't everything he could be in the son department.
Sometimes I think he's more interested in his "Itchy and Mitchy" cartoons than me.
I'm sure it's just a phase, like when I used to stand on the overpass and drop computers on the freeway.
That's how we get our Kaypro.
Hey, Lisa.
Are you counting how many days it takes to wash your big butt?
I  can't hear you.
That's because your butt blocks your ears.
That doesn't make any sense.
Neither does your butt.
I know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy..
and anti-feminist but that's whata fat girl would say.
Lis, look!
Now, I know there's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt.
Maybe not, but you did a great job on the lawn.
Thanks, Dingus I mean, ma'am.
My mother my bully my God!
Lisa, just take a bite.
One bite That's all I ask!
Now, I can't have toothpaste tonight.
Here's the money you gave my son.
We don't want your charity.
I didn't give your son charity.
I gave him self-respect.
Self-respect, huh?
No wonder he came home with his vest all buttoned like he was somebody.
Go home to your son, Mrs. Muntz, and try not to have intercourse on the way!
Nelson, what are you doing out this late?
My mom ditched me!
She went to Hollywood to be an actress, but her range is limited!
She's still your mother.
Come inside.
Can I get you a glass of milk?
Cow milk?!
What are you doing in my jammies?
I'm your new roommate.
I call top bunk.
But it's a single bed.
I said top bunk!
Mom, the reason God invented dead bolts is to keep people like Nelson out of your house.
Bart, have you ever eaten a Tootsie Pop?
You know, there's a tough, crunchy shell, but if you lick it, there's a delicious sweetness inside.
Be nice to Nelson, and I'll give you a Tootsie Pop.
Morning, losers.
Mrs. Simpson.
Pancakes, my favorite!
Bart, eat up or you'll be late for school.
I'm not hungry.
You heard the lady, clean your plate!
Savor it.
Let the flavors dance on your palate.
Next on ABC, Who's dropping by to see George Lopez?
We pray it's you!
Open.
Nelson, doesn't that hurt your teeth?
My teeth hurt all the time.
I just try to think about motorcycles.
I don't like the sound of that.
Tomorrow I'm taking you to Dr. Shapiro.
A doctor for your teeth?
What's next, a lawyer for your hair?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me in the night?
Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?
Looking at the skies I seem to see a million eyes Which ones are yours?
I gotta do something about him.
This is the perfect test.
If I can have one dab of frosting and then stop, I'll know I've conquered food at last.
That was too easy.
If I stop here, I still have some dignity.
Well, at least she's not singing Streisand.
Hey Lis, still insecure about your body?
Yeah, a little.
Those mean girls just get to me.
I understand.
I have a sister I think she's dead now who had the same problem.
And I know just the solution.
Sherri. Terri.
The only thing sweeter than you two are these stolen cookies.
Enjoy.
Thank you, Nelson.
Sherri smells, Terri smells Stinky all the way Stink-stink stink, stink-stink stink One-horse open sleigh Thank you, Nelson.
He who haw haws last, haw haws best.
I really appreciate  you teaching those mean girls a lesson.
Tomorrow I can bleacha swear word into their hair.
I'd like that.
Nelson?
Papa!
You came back!
I never meant to leave you, Nelson.
But something awful happened when I went to the store.
Well, that explains a lot.
Who's hungry?
No. I want to hear what happened at the store.
Well, I went in to buy cigarettes Could you gift-wrap them, please?
They're for my son.
I also bought myself a candy bar, which, uh, unfortunately  was filled with peanuts,  to which I am allergic.
I ran outside  just as the circus was  rolling into town.
And that's where I found him.
I brought him back here so he could take Nelson away, and my bruises would heal.
I want to give you a home again, son.
And so do I.
Mom!
I got an acting job.
From the third director I slept with.
I play Lady MacBeth.
I don't have to take my top off, but I do anyway.
Well, I'm glad everything worked out so well.
The Muntzes are back in business.
Yep, the Four Muntzes.
Thanks for finding my Dad, Bart.
And thanks, lady, for making me feel good about myself.
So, now that you're happy again, I guess you won't beat me up at school anymore.
I wish it were that simple.
I really do.
They're a family again.
And so are we.
What happened?
Sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.
And Lisa, what have you learned?
Nothing.
Like many women, I still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight.
But talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?
I guess.
But there's a long way to go.
Come on, say something conclusive.
I'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.
Oh, open-ended?!
Oh, come on, Lisa.
Say everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
That was you.



He went on like we were buddies.
It drove me nuts!
Then it clicked.
This wasn't my dad, here.
He'd become like a kid that I was responsible for.
Like I was the dad, see?
See what happens?
You wake up one morning and things have switched places.
Gimme a light.
The bitch of it is, you're helpless.
You can scream and kick the walls, it's no goddamn use.
Time's moved on, your dad's an old man, you're not immortal anymore.
Do you believe in God?
Times like that make you start to believe.
Finally, you learn to put up with it.
Then my dad fell sick and I I nursed him like a baby.
Wiped his ass, fed him, cleaned his mouth The worst thing was, I didn't want it to stop.
The year after that, I had my first kid.
I don't see why.
I really don't see why.
I told you about a house on Rue Carrel.
On the east side.
You didn't mention the west side.
Whichever side, you knew it was my patch!
Why not the whole region?
You pulled a fast one on me, admit it.
Can't you kill the sound and your cigar?
How much d'you want?
Dunno.
Don't know?
50-50? I set up the deal and you take half for nothing?
Hot stuff!
Hang on!
I can bring know-how and cash.
Sure! Take a lot of know-how to make me swallow that.
What's your offer?
Nothing. Nada!
You're the one sweating it.
I don't need you.
That's a new one!
Hear that, Sami?
I don't give a shit.
Do your business.
Do your deal and stop crapping about it.
I'll give you 'I don't need you.' In the last six months Who found the warehouses?
Without me, you'd still be haggling with that old bag.
And the tennis courts Tennis courts?
The acre along the highway.
If you don't remember that, what you need is a doctor!
So what's your offer?
I told you, 50-50.
OK, plus half of the Belgrand deal.
Like fuck!
Belgrand's worth four times Massy!
Don't give me that!
If Massy's worth shit, why make such a big deal of it?
This it?
On the left.
Cut it out!
You go that way.
Two floors up.
I can't see!
Gimme a flashlight. You have a spare.
What's going on up there?
Search me. A rat must've bit him.
The asshole scared me!
What's up, Sami?
It ran up my leg and bit me!
Where? Let me see.
Fuckin' bit me all over!
I can't see.
What do you want?
My smokes.
OK, fuck you.
Fuck you!
I've thought it over. It's a deal.
What's a deal?
What we said.
Massy and the Belgrand place, 50-50.
When's the due date?
22nd.
How much under the table?
250,000 each. OK with you?
One thing I don't get about Beefy.
If he hates rats, why does he plant them?
Why not plant something else?
What, snakes?
Or his mother?
Feeling better?
And you?
Go away!
When will you be done?
This part tonight.
The rest in two days, minimum.
Thursday?
I'm signing the deal at 11 AM.
Get me the plans by 8.
I can't.
Course you can!
What's the rush?
We can beat him down.
He owes Martens 60,000.
I'll tell Martens to collect.
Why would he?
I know him. He owes me one.
If he finds out, we'll find ourselves buying from him.
Don't be paranoid. He won't know.
You handle Martens, I'll fix the lawyer and City Hall.
You can't go in there!
You're trespassing!
They broke the lock!
You're trespassing on private property!
Where are you going? Get out!
What's your problem?
I own this place!
Clear out.
You're crazy!
No, I'm the owner.
No entry!
I live here.
No! No, you don't.
Where were you?
Stuck in traffic. I came quick Can't you ever do what you say?
I was stuck in traffic!
Bullshit! The watchman says you never came here once.
And now look!
Get this zoo out of here!
Who are you?
Leave them alone.
Who are you?
Housing Rights group.
You the owners?
Guess!
This is illegal.
The law's on our side.
They've been here 48 hours.
There's water, power.
It's their home now.
You want your building back, find a place to rehouse them.
We can get the cops.
The cops are right there. Go get them!
They're not squatters, they're families.
That's the point.
They've only occupied the street side, not the back yet.
Get Lesrec and his guys here quick or we're stuck for six months.
How many apartments are there?
Won't be so easy now!
Halfass!
Hi.
Did you order?
I was waiting for you.
Boy, that looks... What is it?
Electro.
Try it?
You dig this for real?
Seriously?
I listen to it!
What's this shit called again?
Why are you jumpy? Balls itch?
You wanted to talk.
What if I got married again?
Do I know her?
Not yet. I asked her to come meet you.
Wait till you see her.
A beaut!
She's got tits legs up to her chin and an ass!
That should do.
Am I making you awkward?
Do you have to marry her?
Have to?
No, why?
She's not pregnant.
That's not what I meant.
Tell me straight.
You say no, I won't.
Do it, Dad.
If that's what you want.
If it makes you happy, do it.
Sure! Do it.
One other thing.
There's a couscous joint owes me six months' rent.
Every time I ask for it, he whines, 'My wife's pregnant, my daughter's getting married,' etc.
Guess what? The rat's buying tax-deductible real estate!
He's fleecing me and lining his nest with it!
Can you fix him?
It won't take you a minute.
I said OK.
I wrote it all down here.
Here comes Gorgeous!
My son Thomas, Chris.
I have a call to make.
Sit there, I won't be long.
Want a drink?
A kir.
You?
I'm fine.
So you're Robert's son?
What do you do?
I model, for catalogs.
And commercials, if I can.
I auditioned for one this morning.
Competition must be stiff.
All those East European girls.
Why East European?
It's just the way I heard it.
You're in real estate, like Robert?
How's business?
So what's Chris short for?
Yvonne?
No, Christine.
Are you getting at me?
Did I offend you?
Why are you getting at me?
Just kidding.
Are you serious about Robert?
I think so.
We haven't known each other long.
We go out and have fun.
He makes me laugh.
Introduces me to people.
I love my dad.
I don't want him taken for a ride and have to pick up the pieces.
Did you order?
I can't stay.
Order, I'll be back.
Why are you leaving?
I forgot an appointment.
How do you like her?
You're the one marrying her.
I know, but what do you think?
Nothing.
What's that mean?
She's a whore, Dad.
Why? Because she models and stuff?
Because she's a whore!
You asked me, I answered.
Hey, forget it.
Forget it. Sorry I spoke.
Mr. Fox!
Could you ask that gentleman Don't you recognize me?
Thomas Seyr.
Sonia's son?
Tom, right?
How old are you now?
You're here for the concert?
Did you hear him play at Pleyel?
I missed it.
You'll see he's very good.
I'm his manager.
Have you kept it up?
Music?
Do you still play the piano?
Yes... and no.
It got complicated after Mom died.
That's a shame.
You had talent.
I remember you played something for me.
A Haydn sonata, number 32.
It's starting.
I'll be off.
Here's my card.
Come play piano for me.
Come for an audition.
Call my assistant and set a date.
Don't let me down.
I can't focus.
Try again?
I'm too My heart's beating too hard.
No good!
I'm too nervous. I can't do it.
It's not perfect.
Very close.
Close but not quite!
It looks easy but It's very clean.
But the emotion is not very generous.
Can I help you?
You last played when?
About ten years ago.
Ten years without practice?
I practice.
I never gave up completely.
I play for myself, when I'm in the mood, or for friends.
And now you're auditioning?
That's right.
You're too old for the conservatory.
For a competition?
For an agent. A manager.
Manager?
So he'll take me on.
I'm confused.
You're not a professional pianist?
So why a manager?
He offered to audition me.
My mother was a concert pianist He managed her concerts.
I grew up with music.
There was always a piano at home I know about it.
If I'm good, I think he'll take me on.
As what? A pianist?
A concert pianist?
May I ask what you do?
I work.
In what field?
I work in real estate.
I'm a broker, see?
I plant rats in buildings, cut off the water and power.
Sometimes me and my pals go in with baseball bats and force people out of their homes.
What exactly do you want?
Play me something, go on.
What are you doing?
Fuck you, prick!
What's the big idea?
It's an agency downtown.
Call Madame Bouffera.
I spoke with her.
I told you about it. I'm not wacko.
Tell her I sent you and call me back.
What do you want?
I heard you talking to our teacher.
You want piano lessons?
Just someone to judge my playing.
I have a friend, a pianist.
Her name is Miao Lin.
She just arrived in Paris.
She studied at the Beijing Conservatory and won a two-year scholarship.
She has given lessons and concerts.
Are you interested?
Depends.
If so, call this number and ask for Jean-Pierre.
Who's Jean-Pierre?
Me.
What's this rathole?
I've got business nearby.
How's it going?
A strange thing happened.
Remember Mr. Fox?
He managed Mom's concerts.
Tall, faggoty jerk?
I ran into him, we talked.
Guess what?
He asked me for an audition.
Audition? You?
Why not me?
Think I'm not up to it?
Audition for what?
I don't know yet. Depends.
Depends on what?
Look how your mom ended up.
Don't talk about her that way.
What way do you want?
Your Fox is a pimp.
He didn't deal with her fits like I did.
At the end, you didn't even see her.
It was me she talked to.
Don't give me that shit.
What's it to be?
Same as him.
Remember that favor I asked you?
What favor?
The couscous jerk who owes me six months rent.
Sorry, no time.
No time?
Time to see that fag and get psyched up about pianos, but not 20 minutes for me.
Don't get anal about it. I forgot.
I'll see him, end of story.
That's handy. He's across the street.
I don't believe it!
How can you pull this on me?
You said you'd do it, do it.
Is this payback time or what?
Will you do it or not?
No way! Not like this.
Fix your own shit.
Right.
Asshole.
Beat it!
Mounir! The kitchen's on fire!
Quick! There's a fire!
Freeze!
My dad's money!
Touch my dad again, I'll kill you.
Here.
Not so hard, was it?
Do me a favor.
Forget me for a while.
Is that how you want it?
How else do you want it?
Dammit, Dad!
My friend, Miao Lin.
What is your name?
What do you need exactly?
For an audition, to know where I stand.
Hold it. Doesn't she speak French?
She only just got here.
Only Chinese?
Chinese, Viet, and a little English.
Does it matter, no French?
No smoking, no talking?
Pain in the We will work it out, don't worry.
She can coach you real well.
She has coached musicians for competitions.
She is very good.
Do you need some tea?
What about timing and money?
Mornings she has classes, otherwise she's free.
Every day at 2 PM, OK?
That one looks good.
It's pushing it, sizewise.
Over 350 square meters, City Hall may poke its nose in.
You're trading business premises for housing Can you show me Montmorency Villas again?
Same problem.
I have an architect friend I'm Thomas Seyr.
Mr. Fox asked me to call.
He told you?
An audition, yes.
Date?
I don't know.
What's available?
I'll hold.
We've made a shortlist.
I forgot something.
Seyr again. We got cut off.
Go on, I'm listening.
The 23rd? 11 o'clock?
Suits me fine.
Where? What's the address?
Are you busy tonight?
Why?
I told Aline we're having dinner.
Again?
She'll believe it if she sees you.
Pick me up from home.
I cross town so you get laid?
Attaboy!
Who is she?
Who cares?
Tell me or I won't come.
The realty chick from uptown.
Same as before?
The other one.
I won't do it.
Asshole!
You've come for him?
We're running late.
Dinner with a client?
How've you been?
Will you be out late?
Not very.
Does he know I'm here?
He's on the phone.
Fabrice! Tom's here.
Coming!
Night, honey.
I won't be late.
Bye.
She suspects something.
She doesn't suspect, in fact she's happy I'm with you.
Next time, know what?
We change tactics. You drive me home.
To save me from driving home drunk.
Dig it?
Is that all?
You smug, skirt-chasing smartass!
Don't you have any class?
Don't forget the bank tomorrow.
The loan for the Massy place.
You want half, do half the work.
What time?
Horowitz was the magician who revealed all the piano's magic and especially its sparkle.
He had the most marvelous pianist's hands like a delicately muscled racehorse.
I can't do it.
Having somebody behind me puts me off.
I can't take it. It won't work.
I'm not used to it.
Come over here. Stand here.
Look that way.
Two Jacks on the rocks.
Guess what? Verodin told me he wants to build on the east side.
He's tight with the Illouz brothers, so I kept quiet.
But he came on strong, I want to work with you guys.
I told him about the Bussy flour mills.
Guess what? He said he's through with the Illouz brothers.
He's sick of getting shafted.
That's Number 172, with the vacant lot.
The homeowner's getting divorced.
He'll need dough.
Stick our card in his mailbox, he'll call us next week.
That's not my car.
It's mine.
If you puke, you go in the trunk.
Stand up!
Is that you?
Who else?
Everything OK?
I am.
I put him there.
You want him in the bedroom?
That's fine.
Well, I'll Wait a sec.
Fabrice said he may sell this place.
Is it true?
He didn't tell me.
Is business bad?
Not good.
Another drink?
Yeah, OK.
One more and I'll go.
Like this?
Yeah, I know.
Like this?
Excuse me.
I need to talk to my partner.
There's a room next door.
Are you trying to screw me?
It's not what we said.
It's not the same price.
What's my call to Martens worth?
Name a price.
You're a rat!
Stop right there!
Rats are lazy slobs who live off other people's work!
You want to redraft the contract and meet with your lawyer?
It's me.
Hi there!
Been out on the town?
I went to a movie.
Which one?
Hungry? They're closing.
I'm OK.
Have a seat.
You've been eating?
What's the matter?
That's odd.
What?
Isn't Fabrice with you?
No, why?
We're eating later but I got hungry.
I skipped lunch.
We're meeting with a client uptown That's it.
How will you warn him?
Call him on your cell phone from the john?
'She's here, help!
What do I do?' How long have you been fooling me?
Fooling you? How?
Skip it.
How long's it been going on?
I dunno.
How can you not know?
Since day one, I guess.
Whenever he says he's going out with you, he's getting laid?
Listen One girl or several?
Gimme a break! I don't fuckin' know.
You never see them?
No, and I don't care!
Don't care?
I don't give a shit.
Why do you do it?
Why I do it?
You wouldn't understand.
Listen Aline, wait!
Stay away from me!
Wait!
Fuck off!
Why do I cover for him?
Because I love you.
Get lost.
Did you hear me? I love you!
That's how it is. I want you.
Did you never feel it?
What?
Something between us.
So it's all in my mind?
Yes.
It can't be!
Whenever we meet, we're tongue-tied and shy, like two little kids.
Is that normal?
Am I making it up?
Honestly, am I?
Idiot.
You know I'm not making it up.
So, what now?
I don't know.
I have to go. He'll be home soon.
What do you care? Stay.
Stay.
I can't.
I'm leaving. Let's call each other.
That's good.
God, you're making my day.
If you're so damn good, show me.
I play like that?
No, come off it.
I get it!
Of course!
Move over.
Faucet.
And this?
Glass.
Wrong. Cup.
And this?
Matches.
What's this?
Saucepan.
Bad!
If you couldn't make the meeting, why didn't you call me?
Did you make it to the bank?
You got the files, didn't you?
For fuck's sake His secretary's gonna try and catch him.
Anything else you maybe forgot?
All right already.
What's all right?
I messed up. Nobody died.
If we lose the permit, we're fucked.
I realize that.
So what do we do?
You got his secretary. What can I do?
Nothing. It's the best thing.
I'm sick of this. Later.
So what's going on? Because Nothing.
Nothing?
You don't want to tell me?
Tell you what?
Playing piano is making you flip?
Stop it. Now!
Nothing's making me flip.
I'm not flipping.
I'm having a ball. I feel fantastic!
Don't you see?
It's important. I'm serious about it.
It's wicked.
You gonna make dough from pianos?
Not pianos. The piano!
It's not about making money.
It's about art.
What's in it for us?
You coming to meetings all mellow?
Hi guys, I've been playing piano.
Shit, I'll take up the banjo.
It's over your head.
It isn't at all.
Do what you like to relax after hours.
I make balsa models with my kids and I still keep my appointments.
But it's not about appointments.
You don't seem on the ball.
Get on the ball, then do what you want.
Collect Panini figures, baseball cards, do your piano, nobody cares.
Did you tell your dad?
Yeah.
What did he say?
It grabs him.
Grabs him?
It's me.
How's it going?
What are you doing now?
Thinking of me?
All the time?
Think of me all the time.
I think of you.
I need to see you.
Please!
I've had a shitty day.
Don't you start.
What are you wearing?
It matters. Pants? A dress?
God, I knew it!
What underneath?
Stockings? Panties?
You don't have to shout. Whisper.
Pantyhose? Any panties?
Do you love me or not?
You love me!
Do you still fuck him?
Do you still fuck Fabrice?
What's wrong with you?
I'm only asking if you fuck.
Yes or no?
You have no right to ask me that.
So that's it!
When you leave me, you fuck him.
He's my husband!
I know. And what am I?
Why not ask me if I fuck someone else?
It's none of my business.
Of course it is, if you love me.
Do you fuck someone else?
Yeah.
You fuck someone else?
Careful!
Shut up.
Get off my ass!
I don't understand you!
This is all useless!
I'm sick of it!
Where? I can't see you.
What bus shelter?
I'm there.
I see you. I'm coming.
Is it bad?
Need a hospital?
Take me home.
Get a move on!
Lean forward.
Breathe deep.
What do you care what happened to me?
We're done talking, right?
You gonna sit there all day staring at me like a mutt?
Suit yourself.
See if I care.
Shit!
What's the matter with you?
Stop it!
OK, now.
I was set to get half the site just by putting up the cash deposit.
The site was valued at two million but easily worth double.
Gently!
That hurt?
Want another pill?
I'm OK.
I figured a profit of 2.5 million on 300,000 wasn't bad.
So I put up the cash and we signed.
A month later, I heard the city had blocked the sale so I asked him to pay back my cash.
He said sure, Monday, no problem.
Come Monday, zilch.
How long ago was it?
About... three months.
I kept at him but he stopped taking my calls.
Socks?
Leave them on.
When I heard he was in town, I went there.
Who is he?
His name is Minskov.
You don't know him.
He's a Russian.
Where did you find him?
The Riviera, where else?
You don't say.
Can you handle it?
No answer?
What do you expect me to say?
How's your fiancée?
It's over.
Call me!
What happened with my dad?
That's why you wanted to see me?
Not specially.
But I need to know what happened.
Shouldn't I care about him?
No. He's the father, not you.
I'm not sure anymore.
Did you walk out?
He dumped me.
Beat me to it by an inch.
He'd become a total pain.
Always griping and yelling at me.
You said you had fun.
At first. It wore off.
I'm going to ask you something.
Go back to him.
Are you crazy?
Wait, I know what you'll say.
I say no.
Wait.
Think of it as a contract, like a role in a film.
You act.
I'm the producer, I cough up.
How much do you get as a model?
I'll pay you the same.
No, double! It's worth it.
Just stick with him, watch what he gets up to.
I'll call you twice a day and you'll tell me if he's doing OK.
That's all.
If something goes wrong or he starts acting weird or you lose him, give me a call.
See? Nothing to it, right?
I'm not a whore, you know.
What do you mean?
Who says you're a whore?
You.
You did. Robert told me.
I'm his son, right?
Can't expect miracles!
I know.
Mr. Minskov, please.
Did Mr. Minskov go out?
He's in the pool.
Should I call him?
Don't bother him.
St. James Albany Hotel?
Mr. Minskov, please.
It's personal.
Mr. Minskov?
I'm Mr. Seyr's son.
You don't know me Don't you speak French?
Don't speak French, asshole?
What an asshole!
You understand scumbag, motherfucker?
I'll ram French up your ass!
Understand that?
Gloogloo?
You look pretty glooey!
Listen! Money.
You understand that?
Remember Robert Seyr, fuckwit?
Listen, Gloogloo Can I talk to you, Miss?
Hang on, there's a guy I need to talk.
Lotsa love. See you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.
What?
Minskov owes me money.
What do I care?
Are those two apes always with him?
I'm not talking to you.
You could answer my question!
Hands off!
I just want to meet Minskov.
You're getting boring.
Minskov can drop dead.
Matter of fact, I just need to call him and you're dead.
I get it.
That's why you stay with him.
So you can say shit like 'I call him, you're dead.' What a buzz!
I get it.
But it's the opposite, right?
You're scared shitless.
You're shaking.
You have goosebumps.
Wild, right?
You need his permission to breathe.
Are you done?
Fuck off.
It's me.
Again? Go away or I'll scream.
No need to scream.
You're a pain!
Tell me one thing.
I don't understand.
How old are you?
You're young, not dumb.
Why stick with him?
You don't even speak Russian.
You don't need to.
He just fucks you and slaps you around.
Forget it.
Speak up. I can't hear you.
We're all alone.
We can't see each other.
Just say Whatever. I'm interested.
What did you do before?
I didn't hear. Say it again.
I said I should stop What are you doing?
Where are you?
You've moved!
What on earth Make room for me.
Move over!
Here I come!
What do you mean, you only had him on the phone?
What did the bastard come up with?
Dad, you're gonna have to forget your money.
Forget it.
Stop thinking about it, stop counting it at night.
Write it off and move on.
Why?
The guy's dangerous.
He's a thug, a killer.
He's not the Illouz brothers.
He's not one of us.
You crossed his path.
It was a mistake.
Forget it.
Hold on.
What did you talk about on the phone?
Just bullshit.
Didn't you try anything?
I told you, there's no way.
I fucked his girlfriend.
You fucked his girlfriend?
I just told you.
I ask you to get my money back and all you do is fuck his chick?
I don't believe it.
You're turning dumb.
You're turning very dumb.
You there, Dad?
She said she'd gone off sex since they split up.

She goes sex-crazy.
Grabs my dick and sucks it.

Sorry.
A real friend!
