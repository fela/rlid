At the start Cameron seemed flaky and too generic. As a businesswoman I admire dynamic ideas and leadership and there didn't seem to be much of that.

I crave the "real change" Cameron promises but I’m unsure I trust him. Slagging off the opposition was an obvious trick too. However as he went on I was surprised, as he seemed quite in-touch.
Cameron also made Labour’s approaches feel dusty and clunky and no one will argue with the fact that so much of our country is broken both socially and economically. I’m fed up with a government that supports the lazy and penalises the successful. I was particularly impressed by Cameron's promise of change at speed – that urgency is important.
So will I opt for Brown’s "safe hands" or Cameron’s radicalism? Cameron’s slicker, more entrepreneurial approaches are closer to my heart but I’ve always felt that Labour were more for me. But I’m more likely to vote Tory now than I was prior to the speech.

I don’t consider myself an instinctive Tory voter, so I was a little dubious beforehand about whether Cameron’s speech would change my opinions. It didn’t answer a couple of my lingering questions about Conservative associations in Europe or its policy toward the BBC.
From a personal perspective, too, I still dislike the idea of providing families with tax cuts, because I feel that I’ll be discriminated against financially.
Although I felt that the delivery without notes was a gimmick, Cameron came across confidently and passionately and seemed Prime Ministerial, which is something that I think had been lost recently.
I was also pleased that, for people like me, he acknowledged there are still questions about the Conservatives and their leader. On the strength of this speech I’m certainly willing to listen to what the Conservatives have to say come election time, but I’m unsure yet whether I’d actually vote for them.

"Putting the government on a diet” was the most refreshing line of the speech for me.
After the turmoil created by the expenses scandal it was important to restore some faith in the electoral system. Let's hope that he also turns his attention to building slimmed down the European government.
He was also persuasive in emphasising that a further five years under Brown would not be a savoury prospect. And his attacks on Labour's economic record rang true – the Tories do have a history of pulling Labour out of the cauldron of over borrowing and excessive spending.
I'm probably more likely to Tory now because Cameron showed they were taking the lead on reducing the size of Government. But I still don't find Cameron himself very convincing. He described himself as a salesman I would not buy a lot from him.

Floating voter, traditionally Labour
Cameron’s passion came across with his decision to speak without notes – that always garners my respect.
I felt heartened that he wants to make Britain "great"’ again but was left wondering exactly how he’d achieve this. He used powerful words like "radical"’ and "bold" but his overall tone was still diplomatic
I was interested to hear his take on the welfare system and eradicating benefits cheats but would have liked to have heard more on tackling illegal immigrants.
He effectively demonstrated his leadership credentials by showing how he had changed his party, and the apparent air of unity contrasted nicely with Labour's recent "Bully-gate" scandal.
The speech itself was a crowd-pleaser but I felt it lacked in substance somewhat. Ultimately, David Cameron would get my vote simply for not being Gordon Brown. As the Tories’ campaign slogan says, I will be using my vote to ‘vote for change’.

It was a tough speech. Polls go up and down but he had to show that he knows what he wants to achieve in power.
While reassuring the wider public, Cameron clearly wanted to fire up the party activists. He encouraged us to remember what we are campaigning for, as well as making it clear that if we want to win we can't stop fighting for the next 70 days.
And he gave a few powerful examples of the ways in which our country has broken down.
For me, the biggest thing was recognising that we need to change our politics.
The last 20 seconds of the speech proved Cameron's genuine passion in wanting to change things in this country – not just for himself or the shadow cabinet, but for the benefit of country as a whole.

Kirsty Duff and Dave Sandercock were staying in the surfers' resort of Pichilemu along with Andre Lanyon and Laura Hapgood when the 8.8 magnitude quake struck on Saturday.
Neither couple has contacted their family since the tragedy, which is now thought to have claimed as many as 700 lives and severely damaged 500,000 homes.

Chile has been hit by severe aftershocks since the initial earthquake on Saturday - including one of 6.2 magnitude late on Sunday.
Andre Lanyon, a firefighter from Guernsey, and Laura Hapgood, both 29, went to Pichilemu on Friday.
Surfers Miss Duff, 25, a Stirling University student from from Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, and Mr Sandercock, also 25 and from Edinburgh, arrived in Pichilemu on Thursday.
Their families have launched a campaign for information on their whereabouts on the social networking sites Facebook and Twitter.
Mr Sandercock's sister Ellie wrote on Twitter: "People are posting on Facebook from there, yet no news from my bro Dave Sandercock. Can anyone help?"
In later posts, she added: "Are the police/army there yet? What is happening now? Are phones working?
"Any idea how I can try and locate missing relatives there? Various reports of damage in town. Desperate for news."
Miss Duff's cousin Clare Slipper, from Edinburgh, said the last contact her family had with the pair was when they arrived at the resort, which is around three hours from the capital Santiago.
"Nobody has heard from them since Thursday," she said. "They arrived three weeks ago from Peru and were living in a town between the two big cities affected by the earthquake."
Miss Duff's details and a picture of the couple have also been placed on Google Person Finder.
She is described as blonde, 5ft 10inch tall with blue eyes while Mr Sandercock is the same height and could be sporting a beard.
Meanwhile British aid workers from Oxfam began arriving in the country to help the 1.5m people thought to have been affected.
Jeremy Loveless, Oxfam's deputy humanitarian director, said his team had to drive over the Andes from Argentina since Santiago airport remained closed.
"Until our team has been able to reach the affected area and complete an early assessment, we are unclear how we will best be able to assist the thousands of people affected by the quake. We are not asking for donations at this stage," he said.
Troops have also taken to the streets to stop people desperate for food and water from looting.
The quake sent shockwaves out from the epicentre 70 miles from Chile's second city Concepcion. The eight-biggest since records began, it sent giant waves roaring across the Pacific Ocean, sparking fears of a tsunami.
Briton Charlotte Mountford, who lives in a 14th-floor apartment in Santiago, said the city escaped the worst of the devastation as the majority of the modern buildings were built to withstand earthquakes.
"The modern areas are fine; the older areas, the poorer areas, have had a lot more problems - devastated really in parts," she said.
"Lots of old homes and houses have been cracked, facades have fallen off, the walls have tumbled down, there was rubble in the streets much more like a typical earthquake zone."
Describing the aftershocks, she said: "Everything just shakes. It's more than that - it floats, it makes you dizzy, everyone feels like they have vertigo, we are just constantly moving.
"It is like pressure being applied to a wound that's already there because your nerves are so frayed. We are all so tired, we haven't really slept very well because the aftershocks are going on through the night and we are just so scared that it's going to happen again - is this the final straw that is going to make this building suddenly crumble down?"

The Chilean military has taken control of towns and cities affected by the earthquake, it was reported today, imposing curfews and guarding shops from looters as the death toll from the disaster rose to more than 700.

The Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, signed a decree putting the military in charge of security in the province of Concepcion, where looters have targeted markets and supermarkets, hitting food and water supplies.

"We are facing a catastrophe of such unthinkable magnitude that it will require a giant effort [for Chile to recover]," Bachelet said after meeting ministers and generals at the quake-damaged La Moneda Palace.

Concerns are growing over Britons missing in the aftermath of the catastrophe.

An estimated 65,000 British people visit Chile each year, and a number of UK holidaymakers remain unaccounted for. A Foreign Office spokesman said there had been "no reports of any casualties" so far.

The Surfer's Cottage, an eco-cottage for surfers in Pichilemu, central Chile, listed five Britons among its missing.

UK charity workers were due to arrive in Chile today to help with aid efforts.

The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, will visit the country tomorrow on a previously scheduled trip unrelated to the quake.

"Our hemisphere comes together in times of crisis, and we will stand side by side with the people of Chile in this emergency," she said.

As aftershocks measuring up to 7.5 continued to batter the country, rescuers arrived at coastal cities to find that entire fishing villages had been washed away.

There were reports that 350 people had died in the town of Constitución, which was hit first by the earthquake and then by a tsunami.

The death toll was expected to rise dramatically because of the number of missing people. Identification of the dead has been hampered because most were sleeping when the quake struck and were not carrying any personal documents.

More than 100 people remained trapped inside a wrecked 14-storey building in Concepción, Chile's second largest city, 40 miles north-west of the epicentre.

The new building was only half occupied, but an estimated 20 bodies were removed from the rubble, and teams of firefighters were continuing to search the wreckage for signs of life.

An estimated 500,000 residential buildings have been severely damaged by the quake, leaving nearly one in eight residents homeless.

As food, water and fuel ran out, looting erupted in Concepción and police initially attempted to stop the looters using teargas.

A pitched battle erupted inside one supermarket, ending when police and supermarket officials allowed residents to remove essential items free of charge.

Food warehouses were also looted, and Jacqueline van Rysselberghe, the mayor of Concepción, warned: "We are going to have social explosion if aid is not received today."

The Chilean air force sent a 747 filled with police to the region in an attempt to regain control, while military roadblocks were set up outside some cities in an effort to prevent outsiders from joining the looting.

The cost of the quake damage was estimated to be $25-$30bn (£16-£20bn) by Eqecat, a firm based in Oakland, California, that specialises in disaster management software.

Experts at the company said Chile's history of major earthquakes and solid construction had been instrumental in preventing far more deaths, with building codes including earthquake-resistant standards in all new construction.

The Chilean president-elect, Sebastián Piñera, who takes office in less than two weeks, has worked closely with the outgoing Bachelet administration to organise long-term relief.

On Saturday, he asked key disaster relief and government officials to remain in office during the early part of his administration.

He also called for major sanctions against and investigations of construction companies involved in new housing projects that have collapsed.

Ricardo Ortega, the head of the Chilean air force, said yesterday a commercial airline service had been partially re-established and aircraft were now being allowed to land at Santiago's international airport.

With many major bridges destroyed and entire sections of Route 5, the main north-south highway, twisted and torn, delivery of relief aid to many areas has been made difficult and in some cases impossible.

Fears of a tsunami roaring across the Pacific Ocean were quelled yesterday when waves that hit Japan proved to be minimal.

Hundreds of thousands of people fled shorelines for higher ground after the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre, based in Hawaii, warned 53 countries and territories that a tsunami was imminent.

After the centre lifted its warning, some countries kept their own watches in place.

France has declared a national disaster after violent storms battered parts of the country leaving death and destruction in their wake.
Prime Minister Francois Fillon said the move would release funds to help communities rebuild.
At least 50 people have been killed in the storms that have swept parts of Spain, Portugal and France.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy is to visit the storm-battered Atlantic coast where 45 deaths occurred.
Many victims drowned or were hit by parts of buildings or falling trees.
"It's a national disaster and my first thoughts go to the victims and to their families, to whom I want to express the government's and the nation's condolences," Mr Fillon said.
"The priority now is to make all the homeless people safe, all the people who are still threatened by the rising waters."
He said flood prevention dykes would be strengthened.
The Atlantic storm, named Xynthia, smashed into the western coasts of France, Portugal and Spain with torrential rain driven by winds of up to 140km/h (87mph).
The weather system has swept north-eastwards into Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. There have also been reports of high winds in the Swiss Alps.

In France, Xynthia put five of the country's 95 departments on red alert - only the second such warning since a new emergency system was introduced in 2001.
More than a million homes in France have lost electricity, from the Brittany peninsula in the west to the highlands of the Massif Central.
Worst affected have been the Vendee and Charente-Maritime regions on the western coast.
Huge waves and strong gusts battered many coastal towns, flooding inland areas and destroying buildings.
Residents took to their roofs in the Vendee region and police helicopters were in action trying to locate and rescue them.
At least a dozen people are said to be missing in France and 59 others are injured.
French national power company EDF said half a million customers were still without power at nightfall on Sunday, AFP news agency reported.
Mr Fillon said it would take several days to restore power everywhere.
Falling trees
In Germany, a man was killed and his wife injured when a tree fell on their car in the Black Forest region, AFP reported.
A female jogger in the western town of Bergheim, and a man in Belgium, were also killed by falling trees.
Earlier on Sunday two Spanish men died when a tree crushed their car near Burgos. A Spanish woman was killed by a falling wall in Galicia, and a Portuguese boy was killed by a tree in Paredes.
Air France said 100 of its flights had been cancelled from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.
Wind speeds hit 175km/h at the top of the Eiffel Tower, French radio reported.



Police rush Temple Mount as riots spread to J'lem

By Liel Kyzer and Jack Khoury

         

Four policemen were lightly wounded by Arab stone-throwers yesterday during riots that began on the Temple Mount but soon spread to the alleyways of Jerusalem's Old City. Eight rioters were arrested. 

The clashes died down later in the day, apparently helped by the stormy weather.

Senior police officers attributed the riots to the government's recent decision to declare Hebron's Tomb of the Patriarchs and Rachel's Tomb near Bethlehem national heritage sites. That decision has sparked days of rioting in Hebron, and yesterday it spread to Jerusalem, police said. 

But Arab residents of East Jerusalem said the riots broke out because the police allowed a larger than usual number of Jewish visitors to ascend the Temple Mount yesterday. 

The trouble began on the Temple Mount Saturday night, when some 30 Arab men entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque and refused to leave. The police contacted officials of the Muslim Waqf (religious trust), which runs the site, and asked them to persuade the young men to leave, but the men refused. 

Fearing that this was the prelude to a riot, police decided to try to prevent an outbreak of violence by closing the site yesterday to all Muslim men except those aged 50 or older and who were either Israeli citizens or permanent residents (no restrictions were imposed on women). However, Jews and other non-Muslim visitors were permitted to enter as usual. 

At about 8 A.M. yesterday, when the first visitors ascended the mount, the masked men who had barricaded themselves in the mosque on Saturday night began stoning them. 

Police rushed into the compound to try to stop the stone-throwing, but the rioters fled to the mosque and barricaded themselves in again. 

At that point, police closed the mount to visitors, but the young men continued periodically stoning the police forces stationed there. 

Standing on rooftops 

There were also incidents of stone-throwing at several other places in the Old City. At 9 A.M., for instance, Arabs stoned a police force near the Antonia Gate, which is one of the entrances to the Temple Mount. 

At about the same time, several dozen Arabs tried to conduct a protest march down the Old City's Sultan Suleiman Street, but were dispersed by the police. 

Arabs standing on rooftops near Lions Gate, one of the entrances to the Old City, threw stones at nearby policemen for about three hours. There were also stone-throwing incidents in East Jerusalem's Ras al-Amud neighborhood. 

Two policemen and two border policemen were lightly wounded by the stone-throwers. They were treated on the spot and immediately returned to work. 

Police had feared that further rioting would erupt following noon prayers at Al-Aqsa. But in fact, the Muslim worshipers dispersed peacefully, and the rest of the afternoon passed quietly. 

One policeman at the site attributed this to the heavy rain, which he said persuaded the rioters to go back home. 

The young men who had barricaded themselves in the mosque apparently left with the other worshipers following the noontime prayers. 

In response to yesterday's events, several Arab Knesset members asked the international community and the Arab League to intervene against what they termed "Israeli aggression in Jerusalem in general and in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in particular." 

Hadash chairman MK Mohammed Barakeh charged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government "interpret the [international] silence as a green light to continue their policy of occupation and of harming sites holy to Islam and Christianity."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Vice President Al Gore on took aim at skeptics who doubt the reality of human-caused climate change, saying he wished it were an illusion but that the problem is real and urgent.

BARACK OBAMA  |  GREEN BUSINESS  |  COP15

Gore, who has made the fight against climate change his signature issue since leaving the White House in 2001, specifically addressed challenges to the accuracy of findings by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

"I, for one, genuinely wish that the climate crisis were an illusion," Gore wrote in an op-ed piece in The New York Times.

"But unfortunately, the reality of the danger we are courting has not been changed by the discovery of at least two mistakes" in reports by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Climate change skeptics have pointed to errors in the panel's landmark 2007 report -- an overestimate of how fast Himalayan glaciers would melt in a warming world and incorrect information on how much of the Netherlands is below sea level -- as signs that the report's basic conclusions are flawed.

The panel's report said that climate change is "unequivocal" and that human activities contribute to it.

Gore's defense of the panel's findings came two days after the United Nations announced that an independent scientific board would review the panel's work in light of the errors.

The intergovernmental panel shared a 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Gore and has driven political momentum to agree on a global climate treaty to replace the carbon-capping Kyoto Protocol.

A December meeting in Copenhagen that aimed to bring about a global agreement failed to reach this goal, and Gore blamed inaction in the U.S. Senate.

"Because the world still relies on leadership from the United States, the failure by the Senate to pass legislation intended to cap American emissions before the Copenhagen meeting guaranteed that the outcome would fall far short of even the minimum needed to build momentum toward a meaningful solution," Gore wrote.

Three U.S. senators -- Democrat John Kerry, Republican Lindsey Graham and Independent Joe Lieberman -- have proposed to restart the process by dumping across-the-board cap-and-trade provisions in favor of sectoral approaches to cutting greenhouse gas provisions.

The new bipartisan bill could target individual sectors and move away from a system used in Europe in which companies would buy and sell the right to pollute, a process that caps and eventually reduces emissions blamed for heating the Earth.

Prudential has confirmed it is in advanced talks to buy one of Asia's biggest insurance firms, AIA.
Reports say it could pay $35bn (£23bn) for AIA, which would make it the biggest overseas purchase by a UK firm.
The Pru said the deal to buy AIA - which is part of the US giant AIG - was a "compelling" chance to create South East Asia's leading insurer.
Prudential has asked for its shares to be suspended pending a further announcement.
In a statement, the Pru said there was "no certainty" that the discussions would lead to any agreement and it could not confirm the terms or timing of any agreement.

The Prudential is already the second biggest insurer in South East Asia. This deal would make it the biggest.
BBC business editor Robert Peston said the deal would be financed by a rights issue which would probably be the biggest rights issue of new shares by a UK company.
Only the emergency rescue rights issues of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds have come anywhere close in respect of amount of money raised, he said.
There had also been speculation that the Prudential's UK life assurance business would be sold off to UK company Resolution.
However, Resolution has released a statement saying it has not been holding any talks with Prudential about the matter.
AIG was bailed out by the US government in 2008 and is now 80% owned by it. In total, the firm has received $182.5bn of government funding.

The 23-year-old brought her Monster's Ball tour to London on Friday and Saturday, which has already been compared to iconic tours by Madonna and David Bowie.
Yahoo's critic raved on their live music blog that Gaga was "a truly great pop superstar at the peak of [her] powers".
"Lady Gaga will go on to perform better shows, packed with more hits and less of the filler which sometimes blights and bloats tonight, but she will never again be so triumphantly of the moment, so alive with ambition and potential."
"Think Bowie as Ziggy or Madonna's ‘Blonde Ambition' tour and you'll have some idea of how seismic tonight feels."
Gaga dazzled critics with her sheer ambition and spectacle; she performed Love Game in a bejewelled New York subway carriage, choreographed a raucous zombie orgy for Monster, and - the highlight of the evening - sung Paparazzi while battling a gigantic, tentacled sea monster using burst of sparks from her breasts and crotch.

She also projected S&M visuals during a costujme change and gave a moving rendition of Speechless, which she dedicated to her father.
"Monster Ball is a full on visual spectacular, a bizarre and brilliant fusion of the goth and glitter sensibilities which Gaga has made her own," Yahoo's critic added. 
"Tonight Gaga ate our brains and ate our hearts, and it felt so good."
Londonist's critic was left "speechless" by Gaga's "crazy" performance.
"What was most impressive about the performance was not the epic spectacle of lights, costumes, or props but the woman behind it all. At only 23 she has managed to go from opening for small bands like Semi-Precious Weapons, to bigger pop stars such as The Pussycat Dolls, to filling arenas like the O2 on her own."
"There's something heartwarming about seeing a rising star pause during a song with tears in her eyes to soak in the reality of how far she's come. She might be crazy, but she's the right kind of crazy."
On the Electroqueer blog, its critic claimed that Gaga had now surpassed the likes of Kylie and Madonna.
"I can honestly say that I have never been to a show this good in a long long time."
"From start to finish and from top to bottom it was just absolutely innovative, creative and a fan boys every fantasy come true."
"It was on a scale that only Madonna could replicate.  Now I confidentially shout it out from the mountaintops - Gaga has cut off Madonna's head and has taken the throne as the 'queen of pop'."  

Wayne Rooney is doubtful for England's match against Egypt on Wednesday after a minor knee problem flared up during Manchester United's Carling Cup final victory over Aston Villa.

The fear at his club and within the England camp is that too much is being asked of the forward, but Rooney insists that he is not concerned about the draining effects of too many games. "I don't feel any pressure or burden really," he said. "To be honest I have probably had pressure since I was 16 so it is something you get used to and deal with in your own way."

The striker said that his sole focus this season is winning more trophies and although the 28 goals to date have given him the opportunity to equal Cristiano Ronaldo's 42-goal tally of two seasons ago, personal milestones are not important to him.

"Cristiano got 42 but I am just looking to contribute to us winning medals," said the 24-year-old. "If that happens [42] it would be great but as long as we win medals it would be even better."

Rooney's looping header completed United's first successful cup defence after they had trailed to James Milner's fourth-minute penalty. Coming on as a first-half substitute for Michael Owen, who had scored the equaliser, Rooney said he had understood Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to rest him but he had felt some frustration at the team selection.

"I was chomping at the bit to get on," he said. "You want to play in finals. Thankfully I have managed to do so and left my mark on the game.

"I knew on Wednesday or Thursday I wouldn't be playing. I had a little bit of a stomach bug and the manager was looking for an excuse to leave me out. When he found out about that it made his mind up. I was still disappointed but it was the correct decision by the manager."

As many as 1,200 patients died amid substandard conditions and care at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and 2008.
But it emerged last week, following the publication of a highly critical report commissioned by the Government, that none of the senior managers who were in charge at the time faced disciplinary action.

Martin Yeates, the former chief executive, received a large pay-off while others were either paid off, walked into another job or were allowed to remain in post.
Now Cure The NHS Campaign, a group created by people who lost relatives or were victims of poor care and support within Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust hospitals, has announced it will take matters into its own hands.
Its leader, Julie Bailey, whose mother Isabel died at Stafford Hospital, said it is considering launching a private prosecution of board members including Mr Yeates, Chairwoman Toni Brisby and nursing head Dr Helen Moss.
"These people need to be brought to account," Miss Bailey, from Stafford, said.
"What they did in our eyes is tantamount to corporate manslaughter and Cure The NHS is looking at bringing a private civil case against the managers for just that.
"This is especially important if the judicial review to get a proper public inquiry fails because none of them has taken the stand in public to give evidence.
"These managers presided over care while our loved ones suffered and died. It doesn't seem credible that they can walk away from Mid Staffordshire unblemished."
The plans to take legal action over Stafford coincided with the news that five other hospitals with high patient deaths had escaped investigation by regulator the Care Quality Commission.
Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Foundation Trust, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Bolton Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust all had unexpected death rates above the national average.
Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat health spokesman, called for the hospitals to be investigated urgently.
"We cannot allow Stafford to happen again," he said. "The Health Secretary has to ensure these hospitals are inspected to clear the air."
An independent inquiry chaired by Robert Francis QC, a specialist in clinical negligence, found that patients at Stafford hospitals were abused and neglected by hostile staff and were left in humiliating and undignified conditions.
Patients, most of whom were treated at the trust's main hospital in Stafford, were "robbed of their dignity", left in soiled bedclothes, unwashed and in states of undress in full view of others, it found.
However, Mr Francis also found that 18 of the 22 board members who ran the trust over the period under investigation had now left their roles, with none facing disciplinary action.
Several doctors involved in Mid Staffordshire have also been referred to the General Medical Council for investigation and the Nursing and Midwifery Council has opened a case file and is investigating at least one nurse.

On Sunday it emerged that GMTV’s Gloria De Piero, 37, who once beat Kate Moss in a "World's Sexiest Woman" poll, is being backed to take Geoff Hoon’s seat in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.
“Gloria would be a huge asset to the party and to Parliament,” one Labour insider told a Sunday newspaper.
“She has a first-class degree, a long history of Labour affiliation and excellent contacts.”
The original “Brown Sugars”, who donned miniskirts and T-shirts reading “Gordon For Me”, helped Mr Brown get elected as rector of Edinburgh University in 1974.
Maggie Barry, now 56, who appeared in a campaign photo with friends Aysha Cockshott and Trish Lucas, recently admitted the idea was to show “a bit of leg to give it a boost”.
Speaking to Piers Morgan about his “Sugars” last month, Mr Brown could not deny that he had a “way with women” at university.
These days Labour’s girls campaign in suits, but their adherence to feminist ideals has not stopped some of them being snapped in some rather more racy outfits.
Among those drawing attention are Luciana Berger, 28, the Liverpool Wavertree hopeful, while In Leeds West, 31-year-old Rachel Reeves is running after taking part in a Tatler-style modelling shoot for a national newspaper.
There is also Emily Benn, the trendy 20-year-old granddaughter of Tony Benn, standing for East Worthing and Shoreham.
In Walthamstow, Stella Creasy is running – described by one blogger as “young, thin, blonde, and intensely pretty”.
But in some constituencies all-female lists have angered Labour activists, who have accused senior party officials of trying to “parachute in” favoured women.
Miss De Piero, the former GMTV political editor, has been described as Tony Blair’s favourite broadcaster.

Mr Cameron acknowledged that the upcoming general election would be ''a tight contest'', but insisted a close race was a good thing as it would focus voters' minds on the choice between five more years of Gordon Brown or a change to a Tory administration.
And asked if it was ''squeaky bum time'' for the Conservatives, he laughed and replied: ''There's certainly nothing squeaking over here.''

Mr Cameron said he wanted to be honest with voters about the fact that Britain was facing a ''tough'' couple of years following the election, but insisted that with a Tory government there would be ''a really bright light at the end of the tunnel''.
In an informal interview with DJ Jamie Theakston on Heart 106.2 radio, the Tory leader also discussed his taste for country and western music, his role in almost preventing a Take That reunion and the ''bed-hopping'' that goes on in the Cameron household.
Asked how morning starts in the Cameron household, he said: ''It starts some time before seven o'clock, normally with the arrival of a small child into the marital bed - either Elwyn or Nancy.
''Sometimes they pitch up in the middle of the night - there's a lot of bed-hopping happens in my house. They do tend to wander in at various times of night, and sometimes you wake up as a result in a different bed.''
He also confirmed press reports from last November that he got between Take That and former member Robbie Williams when he went backstage at the Children in Need concert to talk to Gary Barlow, who lives in his Oxfordshire constituency.
Mr Cameron said: ''I heard this commotion behind me and I didn't turn round straight away - typical politician, I carried on yakking away - and then I turned round and it was Robbie Williams.
''I said 'Oh my God, I'm sorry. I don't want to get in the way of this' and he said something like 'I've been waiting 14 years, another couple of minutes won't make any difference'. I got out of the way and thought I had better get back to my seat quickly.''
Despite the Tories' recent slump in the polls, Mr Cameron said that he wanted the election to be called as soon as possible, adding that it was not too late for Gordon Brown to go to the country on March 25 by declaring the election today or tomorrow.
And he admitted: ''It is going to be a tight contest. It's going to be a tough race and I think that's only right. It is a huge decision to change your government and put a new Prime Minister in place. You are asking a lot of people.
''People in this country are right to really think hard and have a really good look at both parties and take the decision: Do I want more of Gordon Brown or do I want change with the Conservatives?
''I think a close race is a good thing in many ways. People are not just cynical and apathetic about politics, they are angry with politicians after the whole mess of expenses. Turnout at elections is coming down.
''Maybe a close race, where people see a real choice and a real contest between the two teams that can run the country, will enliven interest in politics, get people involved and make people feel that they ought to take part.''
Mr Cameron said he did not want to hide the fact from voters that Britain faced difficult times ahead.
''We have had a really long deep recession, we have got a huge deficit, we have got to lift this cloud of debt off this country to get us moving again,'' he said.
''What the Conservatives are saying about rolling up our sleeves and getting on with it, I think, is right.
''It will be tough for a couple of years in this country, and I don't want to hide that from people, but there is a really bright light at the end of the tunnel and that's what we have got to get to.''

Microsoft was forced to introduce the browser "ballot box" following a ruling by the European Commission that Microsoft's practice of pre-installing Internet Explorer on every new computer was anti-competitive. The Commission accepted Microsoft’s offer of rolling out the ballot box across its range of Windows machines, which it believes will make it easier for computer users to choose an alternative browser to Internet Explorer.

"Millions of European consumers will benefit from this decision by having a free choice about which web browser they use,” said Neelie Kroes, the EU's competition commissioner. Ms Kroes said the ruling would also act as an incentive to rival browser makers to continue developing and improving their products. The ruling remains in effect for five years, and applies across the European Economic Area.
The ballot box will be pushed to Windows users running XP, Vista and Windows 7, via an automatic software update, and will only be shown to computer users who are not already running a different default browser.
The box, headed, "An important choice to make: your browser", will feature Opera, Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Firefox in a random order on the first section of the ballot screen. The other browsers, including Flock, Avant and Maxthon, will be listed in a random order on the rest of the ballot screen. There is information below each browser outlining its key features, and a button that allows computer users to easily download and install the browser of their choice.
Some computer experts have expressed concerns that computer users could be confused by the update, and worry that their computer has been compromised by hackers or infected with a virus.
According to web measurement firm Net Applications, Internet Explorer has a 62 per cent share of the browser market, with Mozilla's Firefox browser its closest rival with a 24 per cent market share.

The England and Wales Cricket Board has named England's provisional 30-man squad for the ICC World Twenty20, which begins in the West Indies on April 30.

The squad – which will be halved by 30 March – includes five uncapped players: Steven Finn of Middlesex, Hampshire's Michael Lumb, Somerset's Peter Trego, Yorkshire's David Wainwright and Warwickshire's Chris Woakes.

Geoff Miller, the national selector, said: "The ICC World Twenty20 is an exciting tournament and we have selected an exciting crop of players. All have shown their ability in the shortest form of the game and the selectors have some difficult decisions to make when reducing the squad to 15.

"We have a number of young players knocking on the door, which underlines the depth in talent currently available and I know all concerned will be hoping they make the final squad for what is a highly anticipated tournament."

'My bum is high and curved, my waist has slimmed right down and my cheekbones are more defined. I wasn’t looking forward to posing in a bikini, but I don’t look too bad!'

Claire, who found fame in TV soap Brookside, had been struggling to get back in shape after appearing in a documentary in which she tried to gain as much weight as possible to highlight the dangers of overeating. 

On My Big Fat Diet, which aired just over a year ago, Claire went from 9st 12lb to 11st 10lb. 'The weight gain was so quick,' said Claire, who ditched her healthy lifestyle to indulge in custard slices and burgers.  

'I took my foot off the brake and gained 2st in six weeks. But I had a ball doing it!'

Once filming finished, Claire was faced with shedding the extra pounds – and although she initially lost a stone with WeightWatchers and doing weekly sessions with British Military Fitness, her weight loss stalled at 11st 2lb.

'I really loved doing BMF, but the early starts killed me!” she says. At first, being a size 14 didn’t bother the TV presenter as it brought with it an unexpected benefit. 

'I’ve never been chatted up so much,' laughs Claire, who is currently single but dating. 

'I think there was a softness to me because my confidence had gone, and men found that vulnerability appealing. I remember one guy saying: "You’re glowing." I realised bigger doesn’t mean unattractive.'

Yet as the months went by, she began to long for her old figure.  'Secretly, it was getting me down,' says Claire. 

'I felt older and I couldn’t wear 60 per cent of my clothes. I wanted to wear my beautiful Roland Mouret fitted dresses and skinny jeans, but nothing fitted.'

So just after Christmas Claire started working with personal trainer Sarah Williams and embarked on a Closer diet devised by nutritionist Juliette Kellow. 

Since then, the actress has been training three times a week in a park near her London home. The hour-long sessions involve a run and then a series of exercises, including squats, jumping jacks and boxing. 

'I hated running, so we built it up slowly and now I can run comfortably for an hour.

'My best tip is to go running with a buddy. Or listen to a book on your iPod. I run to Ozzy Osbourne’s life story!'

'I feel loads better these days,' she says. 'But I find losing weight harder now. If I’d trained this hard five years ago I’d have been a rake by now!'

Not that heading towards 40 worries her. Claire admits having Botox injections to smooth her forehead but won’t have more radical treatments. 

'Fillers? No way,' she says firmly. 'I use Crystal Clear facial products and I’ve inherited my mum’s great skin, so hopefully I won’t need to do anything else. I see pictures of myself in my 20s and I think I look better now.' 

Claire’s been single since splitting from her long-term partner in 2007. But she jokes that should she decide she wants a child, she has plenty of opportunity, saying: 'I’ve got lots of gay friends who keep offering to father a baby for me!'
