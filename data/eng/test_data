U2....Do you read me?!
It's already been 6 months since Hee went into hiding.
Maybe she was taken back due to the risk of exposure.
Hi!
Hi!
I dreamt about U2 last night.
He said he'd busted Hee.
Goodbye. You know this song?
I don't like music.
You know that, don't you?
September 1998 Seoul May I help you?
I was having a little chat with my buddies.
About what?
Love.
And?
They say love's to stay together until the last moment.
They know the pain of separation.
I bet they do, seeing each other sold off.
Have you ever seen fishes cry?
How do they cry?
Cry in the water, then you'll know how.
You're about the same size as my boyfriend.
Have you ever seen fishes laugh?
No.
It's already been a year.
It was raining then, too.
You came back the next day to buy a fish bowl with a CD for me.
I said, ''May I help you...'' 'Anapus' Yeah, you said ''Anapus'' instead of ''Anabus''.
'Bus!' A total stranger gave me a CD I really liked.
It was coincidental, but you felt so close as if I'd known you for a long time.
Did you go to the Alcohol Cessation Class today?
The doctor said that I no longer had to come.
Take a guess.
Ki Ki...?
Ki You're unbelievable!
They're 'Kissingurami.' Kissingurami If one of them dies, the other dies, too.
They dry up from malnutrition or their scales fall off.
Don't let them die.
Feed them once a day and change the water Every 5 days.
They don't survive where it's dark and cold.
Keep the lights on all the time.
I might do the same thing if you left me alone.
Kissingurami.

He's down!
It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath.
It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath.
Please don't put ashes into the fish bowl.
My goldfish smokes, too.
Dr. Min, Identified It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath.
Hey, oddball!
Lim was the head of black-market weapons dealers.
We knew nothing about his organization.
When'd he call you?
Right before I called you.
The perpetrator was there at the same time.
Considering the fact that he was hit at the scene he wasn't being followed.
Otherwise, he would've been killed before the rendezvous.
My life is on the line.
I'll tell you the details later but it's about my client who is onto something very dangerous.
Let me tell you again.
If you don't protect me. His life was being threatened during the weapons deal.
Our priority is to find out who his client was.
We went to meet him right after the call.
The big question is how'd this client know we were meeting?
Autopsy reports came out.
What's up?
It's Wednesday.
Get the smell off the bowl.
Don't put cookies into it, then.
You can't feed the fish the same thing all the time.
From the 1st to 4th cervical vertebrae one bullet went through between the 3rd and 4th and the other penetrated between right and left atrium which killed him instantly.
The heart was completely destroyed.
I've never seen anything like this before.
The former coroner has.
Dr. Kim, Director Cho.
They're all the same.
She's at it again.
Goodbye. Chodo Harbour, North Korea For the Victory!
For the Victory!
No more corrupt politicians!
No more 50 years of separation, disgrace, and humiliation!
We're writing a new history of Korea!
And the beginning of it is in your hands!
I expect to see you all again under a unified sky.
Good luck.
For the unification.
For the unification.
Team 4, go!
Don't move!
Hand's up!
He left nothing related to his business.
No wonder.
They destroy everything that could be used against them.
It's hard to find any connection between Lim and Hee.
Then, we're back to square one.
People around Lim?
Lim took care of the business by himself.
Nobody knows anything.
Hee's been hiding out for over a year.
I don't get it. A weapon's dealer was her first target.
It's too easy for her.
Aren't we overreacting?
Could it be a gang war imitating her?
Nobody can imitate her.
We need to find out what she wanted from him and why he contacted us.
What did Hee ask him for?
What was the information Lim tried to give us?
If she hasn't gotten what she wanted from him yet she'll try to get it through other channels.
We need to focus on the fact that North Korea's using her again even though her identity has been exposed to us.
You two are the best agents we've got.
Finish her at your first priority.
What do you think was their relationship?
Why'd she approach him?
I guess she needed something from him.
That's it. That thing she asked him to get her. That's the key.
What'd he mean by something dangerous?
You look awfully serious.
We're late, come on.
I got delayed at the beauty parlor.
Have you waited long?
Not long.
How do I look?
We'd better hurry.
Did you sleep well?
Did I snore?
I was worried about that.
Were you tired?
He always sleeps at the theater.
I wish you had somebody for times like these.
You two are here.
He isn't into anything.
He doesn't even like to sing or listen to the music.
Really?
I grew up near the airport cause my old man was a pilot.
So I can't tell a noise from a rhythm.
Nothing's music to my ears.
Then, what do you like?
I like looking for people.
Lately I've been looking for my ex-girlfriend.
What's she like?
You want to take a look?
She's cute.
Why did you break up?
So I can look for her.
Gosh, I'm sorry!
No problem.
Wipe it off with this.
Here I am really sorry.
It's OK.
It's punishment for dozing off in the theater.
Excuse me.
When is your wedding day?
20th of next month.
When are you gonna tell her?
You can't hide it forever.
I don't wanna burden her.
What if you die on a mission?
What about her?
I can't, anyway.
Why not?
You don't trust her?
Don't be sentimental.
Let me ask you something.
If Hee and I point a gun at each other and you have to choose one.
Who would that be?
Hee, of course.
I'd save your ass cause I can bust her later.
You don't get many chances.
You don't get many friends you'd die for, either.
It's not too late, man.
You can change your mind.
Cheers.
I'm all wet!
Wait till that stain gets washed off.
I've had it.
Give me money for laundry.
Ask her.
I'll pay for it when I do that again.
Aim well next time.
I'll try.
Where are all the taxis?
Let's take a subway.
In this rain?
You're wet anyway.
I don't have a girl to take care of me if I catch a cold.
Come on, let's run!
You sure?
It's gonna rain all night long.
I like it.
I don't think they do.
It's bedtime for them.
Looks like the rain woke them up.
What are they saying?
They want us to keep quiet.
How are your Kissingurami?
They fight a lot.
One minute, they hate each other next minute they're hugging, kissing and stuff.
They're always like that.
When I go out, I get worried about them.
If I am not there, you have to take care of them.
I don't think I can.
I can't even handle 'Kissing' and 'Anabus' at home That's why you have to learn more.
To live with them, you have no choice.
Your sweater is almost done.
I hope it looks good on you.
What should I get you for the wedding?
All I want is whatever happens to me, you love and never leave me.
That's all.
Because you're the only one who truly understands me.
shiri Step 1 On!
On the 17th, 1 million dollars were transferred from Lim's account into Kim's.
Kim?
He looks most suspicious on the transaction record.
Who's he?
Natl Defense lab researcher.
Kim speaking.
Yes.
Okay.
As a part of new weapons system being developed we launched the CTX project last year.
If Kim was doing business with the weapon's dealer chances are very high that it was CTX.
Tell me more about the CTX.
CTX is a new type of energy originally invented by Korea Energy Development Lab we've been working on turning it into a weapon.
At first, we had problems with its delicate detonation conditions but the test we did last month was successful.
People at your agency know about this, too.
It'll bring a sensational change to the military weapon system.
How's it different from the conventional bombs?
It's a liquid bomb.
What's most amazing about CTX is that it's indistinguishable from water.
When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color and you can't detect the liquid itself with any devices.
Yet the effect is ten times more powerful than any other bombs you've ever seen.
What if a black-market dealer got it?
He could get the information on it but not the CTX itself.
Because you need 3 or4 approvals to release it.
If Mr. Kim took a bribe to hand it over he would've returned the money.
Where's it made and kept?
That's confidential, sorry.
But CTX's never been released until today.
How are you so sure?
When CTX is released it goes through3 authorization checkpoints and this morning everything was in order.
You're saying it was released this morning?
For the weapon show tomorrow, it's being transferred to headquarters as we speak.
Sera Mike 1, stop at Dongsan service area.
Will Hee turn up?
She wants the CTX.
She wouldn't miss this chance.
Why are they bothering us?
They want two secret agents to ride with us.
What for?
What the hell is that?
Sir, We need to check the vehicles.
I wasn't informed of this.
What's going on?
We got a report of a possible interception of CTX.
Your permit and ID, please.
CTX's safe with us.
Get out of the way.
Didn't you hear me?
I asked for your permit and ID, didn't I?
This is Sera Mike 1, we're stopped at a checkpoint.
I don't have time for this.
I'll fax it to you.
If you resist, we'll have to arrest you.
What did you say?
We'll have to arrest you or kill you.
Are you nuts?
I'm fine.
Are you out of your mind?
You fucking moron!
Are you fucking nuts?
Wait, look at this.
What base are you from?
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea!
Sera Mike 1, Do you copy?
They've been hit!
It's worse than we thought!
It's a bomb, run!
Hee asked Lim for the CTX and Lim bribed the researcher to hand it over.
But when they realized it couldn't be done they planned to intercept it on the road.
In the process, Lim and Kim were murdered, along with 20 of our armed guards.
How much CTX was taken?
About a gallon.
It is enough to blow up an entire city.
Any leads on the interceptors?
Not yet, sir.
Just an assumption that they're involved with Hee.
But why would North Korea do that in a time of reconciliation?
We haven't seen the hidden camera mounted on the vehicle but the gunfire at the scene makes me think that they're highly-trained North Korean militants.
Their military system is falling fast.
We can't rule out the possibility that they were a private organization wanting the CTX for their own purpose.
The question is what are they planning to do with the CTX.
If it blows up in Seoul, we're finished.
Why not make an official statement to the North-Korean government?
Not until we have solid proof.
We also need to figure out why their target was the CTX.
As you all know, it may explode without the detonator.
And no devices can detect the liquid itself.
If they utilize those traits, expect the worst.
There's no way to predict when, where, or how it's gonna go off.
Dinner?
I don't feel like it.
Is the meeting over?
Little while ago.
Anything special?
Ready to order?
Hi!
Hi!
Beer, please.
What about the scene?
An inspection of the scene was delayed and the bodies were just taken to headquarters.
The film will be handed over tomorrow.
Any leads?
Just bodies and shells.
Isn't it strange?
Anything else?
This is the third time.
Lim, Kim.. This time CTX was intercepted.
We went to see Lim right after the call .. and to the lab right after we got the report.
We're always a step behind.
It's like they were reading our moves.
There's a leak.
It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information.
Don't jump to the conclusion.
Today we went to the lab without notice.
Kim didn't even know that we were coming and he got killed 5 minutes before we got there.
If that's the case it's obvious.
Only director Ko and I knew about those killings and CTX.
And you made the report.
shiri 1's entered.
It's been a long time.
At 09:00.
With sunglasses on.
You've changed a lot.
It's been six years.
How's my family?
They're fine.
I miss them.
Completion is near.
You'll meet them soon.
A barrier is in the way.
Get rid of it.
Target?
Kissingurami.
Finish the job before the completion.
Acknowledged.
For the unification.
For the unification.
We're always a step behind.
They were reading our moves.
There's a leak.
It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information.
Hello?
It's me, Ho.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Sure, what's going on?
I have a favor to ask.
Call me at the Police Agency tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
I'll call you.
What are you doing there?
You scared me!
You just got here?
No, earlier.
I cleaned and did the laundry.
Nothing was in the refrigerator.
We ran out of coffee so I went grocery shopping.
What's wrong?
You don't look so good.
Just busy at work.
Why didn't you call?
I was gonna leave soon.
Dinner?
Not yet.
I had a late lunch.
Let me fix dinner for us.
What are we having?
Your favorite.
You wanna take a shower?
After dinner.
I think it's done.
Let it simmer.
Can you hand me the cloth pins and hangers from the sofa?
I couldn't find the pins.
It's OK.
Leave it, I'll do it.
When are you moving in?
Soon, I guess.
I haven't packed up yet.
Let me help you pack up.
With you here, it won't be as lonely.
You hated eating alone and waking up by yourself.
You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on.
I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music.
Should we buy birds?
You'd like birds singing in the morning.
Promise me that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago.
Trust me.
I'll never drink again because I have you.
A soccer team of South and North Korea returned today to the Seoul Training Center after training in Pohang with North Korean officials coming through 'Panmunjum'.
The North Korean President Lee and officials coming to the south for the game and a conference will deliver a message on a permanent peace. When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color you can't tell the difference from water with the naked eye.
But it's a different story with the light on.
Turn it on.
It's on.
CTX responds to daylight over 6000 kelvin.
The light alone may start its reaction but without heat, it's no good.
Fire.
What?
Yes, sir.
It's on, sir.
If you expose it to both light and heat nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently.
But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops.
Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion.
How much power does it have?
This is about 200cc, so everything within the radius of 1 kilometer would disappear.
Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction the sensor here tells you when it's exploding.
Like now, if the sphere becomes red it means the explosion is imminent.
If you don't stop it before the sphere pops, it explodes.
But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops.
I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years.
You're an oddball.
I am not, sir.
Admit it!
No, I am not.
Admit it!
Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fish bowls.
Agent Ryu, come to room 17.
I gotta go.
Find CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking.
We'll find it!
Anyone recognizes him?
Don't you remember, Ryu?
His name is Park.
A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces.
When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked he was the only one that escaped from the plane a painful memory for Ryu.
Clear!
Hee and Park All the pieces are coming together.
Agent Lee?
Find out what's going on with 8th special forces.
And you get the daily data of spy satellites from Natl Defense.
Agent Yoon!
Yes, sir.
Post Park's montage throughout the country.
They're 8th special forces.
It's worse than we expected.
The 8th special forces intercepted CTX, why?
Three possibilities here.
First, to sell it off to a third country.
Second, to use it on the negotiation table for money or to seek asylum to another country.
Third, a strategy they are known for they say they want peace and stab us in the back.
It must be either for the money or an explosion.
If they wanted the money, why CTX?
Robbing the Bank of Korea'd be much easier.
Why'd they spoil the peace conference by using the bomb?
That's difficult to answer.
Hee is key to all this.
We don't have time.
We'll find a way.
What do you see?
Can't even tell me?
Maybe the solution is much closer than we think.
What do you mean?
Hee could be close by.
Hey, you!
What the hell are you doing here?
I am looking for the man's room.
Are you fucking blind?
Didn't see the sign ''RESTRICTED AREA''?
Hey, you hear me?
I sure did.
Watch your mouth.
Take care.
How have you been?
Bored to death.
I feel more insecure when it's so quiet.
I need some backup.
What about your agency?
The air isn't very clear there.
What do you mean?
I think there's a leak.
This is the only way.
It must be very stressful.
It'll get better.
When do you need it?
Tomorrow.
I'm coming, too.
Sorry, no married man.
Time and place?
I'll call you.
All right, then.
Ho!
We'll talk later.
How's your friend?
He'll live.
I am glad to hear that.
Have a seat.
Who else knew you two were meeting?
It was very personal.
I didn't tell anybody.
Lim, Kim, Ho. Hee is very nearby.
There must be a leak.
Nobody knows that for sure.
Internal affairs are on it.
You don't trust your men?
Do you trust me?
Traps could be anywhere.
Maybe there's a hole in the security system but that possibility is almost zero.
Don't share the information with anybody.
Not even with your partner, Lee.
Traps under your feet are hard to see.
I'm the Director in charge.
I'm Park, of the 8th special forces.
I want to talk to my old friend.
Thanks for calling me friend.
I was gonna send you a coffin, but you were lucky.
Disappointed with Hee's shooting.
Save it.
We can take you out anytime.
Maybe I'll take you out first.
So, you've become a man.
You know where I am?
Young drunk kids here yelling on the street. While people in the north are starving to death.
People here have wastes building up in their bellies.
What an unfair world.
Listen, friend.
We have 10 CTXs placed all over Seoul.
I'll call you 30 minutes before each of them goes off.
You'd better find them before people get hurt.
What do you want?
Slow down, friend.
The first one is on the roof of the Golden Tower.
You have exactly 30 minutes.
You know the fish named shiri?
It's a Korean aboriginal fish, living in crystal streams.
Though they're separated with the country divided some day they'll reunite in the same streams.
Should I buy some for your girlfriend's fish shop?
Why not.
Stay alive until then.
He's on the move.
Clear!
Found it!
Hyun?
Don't tell anybody you're here.
Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here.
I checked you in under an alias.
Don't go out.
I'll take care of the shop.
What's going on?
Don't ask.
Please do as I say.
I don't wanna stay here.
Hyun!
You haven't touched a drop for a year.
This is me.
You know that, don't you?
What is it?
What?
You wanna know what?
Tell me what's wrong.
Dear People of the South Today marks an important and joyous moment in our history.
I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissension and to open up a new era of understanding.
You got a call.
Hello?
A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me.
He's Hee's informant, and wants a deal.
Where are you?
I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center I'm on my way.
Be there.
On my way.
He's wearing a black jacket and a black cap.
Anything else?
That's all.
I'll be right there.
You look good in a black jacket.
Anyone else coming?
Hee, maybe.
So you called me expecting someone inside to leak the information?
I hope it worked.
Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here.
You know it's impossible to tape the phones.
So, if they show up Im the rat?
The MSG-90 Hee uses is a 5-shot semiautomatic.
She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho.
In both cases, you were in her range.
If I were her I would have used the other three bullets.
3 targets went inside.
Acknowledged.
Stay in position.
The mole must have been found.
For the unification!
Been a long time.
Good to see you.
Payback time for the flight 257.
Look who's talking.
You killed 7 of my men.
You left your men behind.
Cause I have a job to finish.
You wanna know what it is?
I'll ask Hee.
It's my turn to send you a coffin.
Won't be easy!
Get back!
She used only two bullets.
'In both cases, you were in her range.' lf I were her '...I would have used the other three bullets.' Name: Hyun Residency: Cheju Island Innate Immunodeficiency Syndrome Admitted at Halla Hospital.
Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island.
Why'd you come here?
They ambushed us.
OP set a trap.
Because you didn't follow orders to kill Ryu.
If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences.
Killing him. It was my personal order.
When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you.
Thanks to you, we lost two of our men!
I did what I could do.
Yeah, you saved my life.
What do you want?
You've changed.
Of course I have from Hee to Hyun.
Not only in appearance, but inside as well!
I don't need a betrayer.
We've waited 10 years for this moment.
In those hours of pain, we pledged allegiance and buried our youth in the tomb of history.
If you want to turn your back on us over personal feelings finish it here.
I was stupid thinking I could be Hyun.
But I am just Hee who has to kill her man.
I failed to change my inside.
Let go!
We have a job to finish.
Avoid any physical contact with her, and no smoking because her immune system has dropped and make it quick.
There she is.
with the yellow sweater.
Do you mind if I sit here?
Sure.
Are you from the public health center?
I am looking for this girl.
Anything happened to her?
She's my old friend.
I need to find her.
She rented a room in our house 2 years ago and she'd visit me here quite often.
She was very nice to me as if she were my real sister.
She said she'd call me from Japan but I think she misplaced my number otherwise she'd have called.
She went to Japan?
She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body.
The day she left I cried my eyes out.
She hugged me, and went on about how sorry she was.
I didn't even know what she was sorry about She didn't do anyting to me Prepare 10 million dollars and a 7 47 Jumbo at the airport by 2 o'clock.
No mistakes.
The Golden Tower was just the beginning.
I hope I don't have to use the other 9 CTXs.
Hello? Hello!
Don't put cookies into the bowl.
Two of them died today.
I am not a fish shop boy.
I'm an OP agent, too.
You know how many fish bowls we've got here?
I don't wanna deal with dead bodies any more.
It's the cookies that killed it.
No autopsy is needed. If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences.
Killing him. It was my personal order.
When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you.
The soccer game between the South and North will finally be kicking off at Seoul Main Stadium at 2 P.M today.
With the Presidents of two nations present Hi, I'm here to collect for the newspaper.
How much?
7 dollars.
It's all right.
Bye.
What are you doing here?
Going to a soccer game?
I had 4 goldfishes on my desk with 4 goldfishes, and 2 of them died today.
At first, I thought it was the cookies that killed them.
But I was wrong 'SU300' inside their bodies is a high-tech bug that can be used underwater.
I suspected my partner these last few days, including you.
I planted some bugs here and got the information that I didn't want to get.
From October 1996 to August 1997 When Hee disappeared, you were in Japan.
You didn't need a fake passport coming back in because you became Hyun.
Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth.
What makes me sad is that my buddy, Ryu loved you with all his heart.
Let me ask you this.
Did you really love him?
Over here!
I planted a bug in your car Will you.... forgive me?
Stay with me!
The ambulance is on the way!
I.... messed up.
You're going to be Okay.
You've always been the best!
This won't.... kill me. This won't. Stay with me!
The 7 47's here.
Holding position, 100 meters northwest from the terminal 2.
Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position.
Their target is the soccer game.
They're on their way to the stadium.
What are you talking about?
No time to explain.
The stadium is at stake!
They've set CTX around Seoul and want 10 million dollars.
They were bluffing.
Why the stadium?
All the North Korean leaders are gathered there.
Why would they do that?
How the hell do I know?
Call off the game immediately and evacuate all the spectators.
Are you out of your mind?
Call off the game?
Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium!
Go back to Headquarters.
Don't worry about the stadium.
Not even a drop of water can pass through security.
It won't work.
Listen to me!
You lost your partner today.
Go back, it's an order!
I understand about liquor, but why not coffee?
It's the rule, sorry.
Your attention, please!
No beverages will be allowed into the stadium.
Thank you for your cooperation.
The game will begin in 30 minutes.
If I were in the airport, no doubt I could prove myself.
But what the hell am I doing here, watching the gate?
Both teams are now entering the stadium.
What are you. How have you been?
Attention, please.
Both Presidents Kim and Lee have just arrived!
Let's give them a big hand!
Get the lights ready.
3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G.
Turn them on./ Turn the lights on?
Who's in charge of the lights?
What's wrong?
Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box?
